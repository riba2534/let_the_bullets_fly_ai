2
00:06:10,24 --> 00:06:12,43
你一个师爷敢冒充县长？
You dare to impersonate the Governor?

3
00:07:38,40 --> 00:07:40,03
那就要看你的本事了
That's all up to you.

4
00:07:41,84 --> 00:07:44,43
师爷，当夫妻最要紧的是什么？
What's important for a couple?

5
00:07:44,64 --> 00:07:45,59
恩爱！
In love.

6
00:07:45,76 --> 00:07:47,35
听不见，再说一遍
I can't hear you.

7
00:07:47,60 --> 00:07:48,71
恩爱！
In love.

8
00:07:48,88 --> 00:07:50,02
来，见过母亲大人
Six, come greet your Mom.

9
00:07:50,20 --> 00:07:52,39
母亲大人好，小六子有礼了！
I wish you well, Mother.

10
00:07:52,60 --> 00:07:54,59
你出生入死，还带着儿子啊？
You bring your son to battles?

11
00:07:54,76 --> 00:07:56,83
他爹是我的兄弟，阵亡了
His father was a comrade. Died in battle.

12
00:07:57,00 --> 00:07:58,87
所以他就成了我的儿子
So I adopted him as my god son.

13
00:07:59,04 --> 00:08:01,11
所以呢，你现在就是我的母亲大人！
Now you're my mother.

14
00:08:01,28 --> 00:08:02,26
等这桩买卖做完后
After we're done with Goose Town,

15
00:01:25,68 --> 00:01:28,14
“天之涯”
"To the end of horizon,"

16
00:01:28,68 --> 00:01:31,55
“地之角”
"four corners of Earth,"

17
00:01:31,92 --> 00:01:37,35
“知交半零落”
"scattered one's true friends"

18
00:01:37,56 --> 00:01:43,35
“一壶浊酒尽余欢”
"A bottle of wine for remaining joy,"

19
00:01:43,56 --> 00:01:48,79
“夕阳山外山”
"as sun sets among the mountains."

20
00:01:48,96 --> 00:01:50,67
好，好好
Brilliant...

21
00:01:50,84 --> 00:01:51,71
汤师爷
Counselor!

22
00:01:51,92 --> 00:01:53,51
是好吃，还是好听？
You prefer the food or my singing?

23
00:01:53,68 --> 00:01:55,59
也好听，也好吃
I love them both!

24
00:01:55,76 --> 00:01:57,55
都好，都好！
Outstanding!

25
00:01:57,72 --> 00:02:00,10
我马某走南闯北
Brain and brawn have helped me far,

26
00:02:00,28 --> 00:02:03,75
靠的就是能文能武，与众不同
that's why I am so unique!

27
00:02:03,92 --> 00:02:08,03
不光吃喝玩乐，更要雪月风花
One must learn to live in style!

28
00:02:11,96 --> 00:02:14,83
马县长此番风度
Governor, with your style and poise,

29
00:02:15,16 --> 00:02:16,75
正好比
you remind me of...

30
00:02:16,96 --> 00:02:22,27
大风起兮云飞扬
a modern-day Robin Hood!

31
00:02:22,64 --> 00:02:23,43
屁！
Bullshit!

32
00:02:23,64 --> 00:02:24,91
刘邦是个小人！
Robin Hood is a common thief!

33
00:02:25,08 --> 00:02:27,99
力拔山兮气盖世
with Samson's might and Solomon's wisdom!

34
00:02:28,16 --> 00:02:29,67
屁！ 屁，屁
- Bullshit! - Yes, bullshit!

35
00:02:29,84 --> 00:02:30,79
汤师爷
Counselor,

36
00:02:30,96 --> 00:02:33,03
你要是拍我马屁
if you're trying to flatter me,

37
00:02:33,20 --> 00:02:35,76
就先要先过夫人这一关
you must first woo my wife!

38
00:02:36,96 --> 00:02:38,23
写首诗，写首诗！
Compose a poem in her honour.

39
00:02:38,40 --> 00:02:41,23
要有风，要有肉
It must have a tempest, food,

40
00:02:41,40 --> 00:02:43,59
要有火锅，要有雾
a hotpot, some mist,

41
00:02:43,76 --> 00:02:46,59
要有美女，要有驴！
pretty maidens, and a mule!

42
00:02:58,44 --> 00:02:59,39
起来，起来，起来
Get up!

43
00:02:59,60 --> 00:03:00,99
一起吃！一起唱！
Let's eat, sing and be merry!

44
00:03:01,16 --> 00:03:03,91
报告县长！我们铁血十八星陆军
Sir, we are the elite Republican Guards,

45
00:03:04,08 --> 00:03:05,83
护送县长安全上任！
here to ensure your safe passage!

46
00:03:06,00 --> 00:03:06,79
我们…
We -

47
00:03:07,00 --> 00:03:08,63
不吃饭！
don't - need - to - eat!

48
00:03:18,00 --> 00:03:18,98
没打中？
You missed?

49
00:03:20,64 --> 00:03:22,11
让子弹飞一会儿
Let the bullets fly...

50
00:03:33,44 --> 00:03:34,50
老二老三跟我走
Two and Three come with me.

51
00:03:34,68 --> 00:03:36,19
其他人把白马抓回来！
The rest round up the horses.

52
00:04:51,72 --> 00:04:52,78
火锅？
Raining hot pot?

53
00:05:05,20 --> 00:05:06,79
爹，全都找遍了
Pop, we've looked all over.

54
00:05:07,00 --> 00:05:09,75
没钱，没货，也没有银子
There is absolutely nothing!

55
00:05:10,04 --> 00:05:12,23
人倒是剩两活的，杀不杀？
Should we just kill the two survivors?

56
00:05:18,96 --> 00:05:20,75
钱藏在哪儿了？说出来
Tell me where the money is?

57
00:05:21,24 --> 00:05:22,79
闹钟响之前要是说不出来
Or I'll cut off your head,

58
00:05:22,96 --> 00:05:23,83
脑袋搬家
when the alarm goes off.

59
00:05:26,72 --> 00:05:27,78
哭？
Stop it!

60
00:05:28,28 --> 00:05:29,99
哭也算时间啊
Tears won't stop it from ticking.

61
00:05:31,00 --> 00:05:33,15
有什么就说什么嘛
You'd better come clean with them.

62
00:05:33,68 --> 00:05:35,43
这位夫人，你是谁？
Who might you be, ma'am?

63
00:05:35,64 --> 00:05:37,07
我就是县长夫人啊
I'm the Governor's wife.

64
00:05:37,24 --> 00:05:38,67
失敬！失敬！
Forgive my impudence.

65
00:05:38,84 --> 00:05:40,67
那你就是县太爷？
So you must be the Governor.

66
00:05:43,04 --> 00:05:46,31
有钱！有钱…！
Yes, of course! There's money!

67
00:05:46,52 --> 00:05:47,66
我跟县长进城上任
We're on our way to inauguration.

68
00:05:47,84 --> 00:05:49,15
县长淹死了，现在没有
He ruined it all by getting drowned!

69
00:05:49,28 --> 00:05:50,99
上任就有！上任就有钱
But we can still hit jackpot

70
00:05:51,16 --> 00:05:52,67
上任就有！
if we take his vacant post.

71
00:05:55,20 --> 00:05:57,79
再给你一圈，顺着买官往下说
I'll give you another chance. Tell me more.

72
00:05:57,96 --> 00:05:58,43
有二十万
$200,000...

73
00:05:58,64 --> 00:05:59,59
钱呢？ 买官了
- Where is it? - Bought the post with it.

74
00:06:20,68 --> 00:06:22,79
他，他县长赚过六百四十万！
That's what the "Governor" made.

75
00:06:22,96 --> 00:06:25,19
我不是师爷么，我就赚个零头！
I only get the small change.

76
00:06:25,36 --> 00:06:26,03
没失过手？
Ever failed?

77
00:06:26,20 --> 00:06:28,19
不动手，拼的是脑子，不流血
We use our brains, not brawn.

78
00:06:28,36 --> 00:06:29,67
你这次去哪儿上任？
Where are you heading to?

79
00:06:29,84 --> 00:06:30,95
鹅城
Goose Town.

80
00:06:31,12 --> 00:06:33,11
火车被劫，你的人淹死了怎么交代？
How do you explain the hold-up and the bodies?

81
00:06:33,28 --> 00:06:35,66
车是我买的，人是我雇的，没人追查
I bought the train and hired the soldiers.

82
00:06:35,84 --> 00:06:37,19
没有人追查
No one will ever find out.

83
00:06:37,52 --> 00:06:39,35
别摘！别摘…！千万别摘！
Don't take it off! Leave your mask on!

84
00:06:39,56 --> 00:06:40,15
规矩我懂
I know the rules.

85
00:06:40,32 --> 00:06:41,38
看见你的脸我就活不成
No one lives after seeing a bandit's face.

86
00:06:41,60 --> 00:06:43,31
你把我放了，我上任鹅城
Just wait here for me.

87
00:06:43,52 --> 00:06:45,35
赚了钱，都给你！都给你！
I'll bring you the money once I have it.

88
00:06:45,56 --> 00:06:46,59
弟兄们劫回道
We came to rob a train,

89
00:06:47,32 --> 00:06:48,75
一分钱都没捞着，不合适吧
we can't go empty-handed.

90
00:06:48,92 --> 00:06:49,51
不合适
No, you can't.

91
00:06:49,68 --> 00:06:51,98
你看了我一眼小命就丢了，也不合适吧
If you die for peeking at me...

92
00:06:52,20 --> 00:06:53,42
更不合适
That's even worse.

93
00:06:53,68 --> 00:06:55,39
你那些淹死的兄弟给我用用？
Can I borrow those bodies?

94
00:06:55,60 --> 00:06:58,19
用！…他们欺男霸女，死有余辜
Yes. These bullies deserve no better.

95
00:06:58,32 --> 00:07:00,11
不是，死了有什么用啊？
But what do you want to do with them?

96
00:07:00,28 --> 00:07:02,51
死人有时候比活人有用
They can be more useful than the living.

97
00:07:03,20 --> 00:07:05,03
师爷，睁开眼看我一眼
Take a look at me.

98
00:07:05,20 --> 00:07:06,63
看一眼
Look at me!

99
00:08:42,68 --> 00:08:43,99
你逃过一次
You've escaped once.

100
00:08:44,16 --> 00:08:45,35
你要是再敢耍我…
Try this one more time...

101
00:08:45,56 --> 00:08:47,94
明白！脑袋搬家
You'll have me beheaded!

102
00:08:56,64 --> 00:08:57,43
进城
Let's go!

103
00:09:32,68 --> 00:09:34,55
城里的女人就是白啊
City girls are so fair and delicate!

104
00:09:36,64 --> 00:09:38,27

"Wanted, Dead or Alive!"

105
00:09:39,68 --> 00:09:41,11
爹，你看
Pop, look!

106
00:09:41,28 --> 00:09:42,67
他们怎么把你画成这样了！
Look what they've made of you!

107
00:09:42,84 --> 00:09:44,51
越不像越安全
The less it resembles me, the safer I am!

108
00:09:57,88 --> 00:10:01,19
恭迎县长大人！
Welcome, your honour!

109
00:10:02,04 --> 00:10:04,55
委任状！
Appointment Warrant!

110
00:10:04,72 --> 00:10:09,39
兹委任马邦德为鹅县县长

113
00:10:20,56 --> 00:10:24,23
黄老爷驾到
Master Huang has arrived!

114
00:10:26,52 --> 00:10:30,71
黄老爷吉祥！
Greetings to Master Huang!

00:10:28,60 --> 00:10:30,71
Good fortune to Master Huang!


116
00:10:30,88 --> 00:10:33,44
此乃南国一霸黄四郎

117
00:10:33,60 --> 00:10:37,43
干的是贩卖人口，倒卖烟土的大生意

118
00:10:37,64 --> 00:10:39,55
黄老爷百忙无暇

119
00:10:39,72 --> 00:10:41,75
特命我黄府大管家胡万！
So he sends his majordomo, Hu Wan!

120
00:10:41,92 --> 00:10:44,79
黄府团练教头武智冲！
And his militia coach, Wu Zhichong!

121
00:10:44,96 --> 00:10:48,43
礼帽，礼貌，欢迎县长！
To welcome you, sir, with his hat!

122
00:10:50,68 --> 00:10:52,75
来者不善啊
Who dares win!

123
00:10:53,56 --> 00:10:55,91
你才是来者
Do you dare?

124
00:11:10,76 --> 00:11:11,67
老爷，来了
He's here, sir.

125
00:11:11,84 --> 00:11:12,67
谁呀？
Who's here?

126
00:11:13,76 --> 00:11:14,55
你自己
Yourself!

127

黄大爷万寿！

128
00:11:16,08 --> 00:11:18,54
小的杨万楼，这厢有礼
Greetings from Yang Wanlou!

129
00:11:18,72 --> 00:11:20,71
膺品是个好东西！
A remarkable fake!

130
00:11:21,12 --> 00:11:23,23
膺品是个好东西！
A remarkable fake!

131
00:11:23,40 --> 00:11:25,39
走几步
Take a few steps.

132
00:11:26,80 --> 00:11:28,59
走出个虎虎生风
Walk purposefully.

133
00:11:28,76 --> 00:11:31,27
走个虎虎生风
Purposefully...

134
00:11:31,96 --> 00:11:33,51

走个恍如隔世
Pensively...

138
00:05:59,76 --> 00:06:00,79
买官干什么？ 赚钱

139
00:06:00,96 --> 00:06:02,02
能赚多少？ 一倍

00:06:04,84 --> 00:06:07,11
半年半年！手气好，一个月也行！
A month, if you're in luck.

143
00:06:07,28 --> 00:06:08,99
县长淹死了，谁去上任？ 我
- Who will be the governor? - Me.

144
00:06:09,16 --> 00:06:10,07
你是谁？ 师爷
- And who might you be? - I'm a counselor.

145
00:19:57,96 --> 00:19:59,07
磕不磕？
Do it!

146
00:19:59,28 --> 00:20:00,31
打！
Flog him!

147
00:20:04,68 --> 00:20:05,95
这个不好使
That's no good.

148
00:20:06,72 --> 00:20:07,78
得使这个！
This is more effective.

149
00:20:07,96 --> 00:20:10,31
哎！别打！我磕！
Stop! I'll do it.

150
00:20:11,04 --> 00:20:12,35
行了
Splendid!

151
00:22:19,84 --> 00:22:21,75
那上面印着他名字的时候
If his name was printed there.

152
00:22:25,80 --> 00:22:28,23
爹，这叫穆扎这人
Pop, this Mozart...

153
00:22:28,40 --> 00:22:31,19
他是怎么把这东西吹到这里边的？
How did he get the sound in there?

154
00:22:31,88 --> 00:22:35,42
你去留完洋，你就什么都知道了
You'll learn by studying abroad.

155
00:13:48,20 --> 00:13:50,23
若是夫人有任何要求
But if you have that urge,

156
00:13:50,40 --> 00:13:51,67
兄弟我…
then yours truly,

157
00:13:51,84 --> 00:13:53,71
也决不推辞
would be happy to oblige.

158
00:13:59,16 --> 00:14:00,59
睡觉
Let's sleep!

159
00:14:14,44 --> 00:14:19,03
一日夫妻百日恩呐
Husband and wife - even for a day...

160
00:14:30,44 --> 00:14:33,27
反正呢，我就想当县长夫人
I've always wanted to be a governor's wife,

161
00:14:33,84 --> 00:14:36,99
谁是县长，我无所谓！
and I don't care who the governor is.

162
00:14:37,96 --> 00:14:39,95
兄弟，别客气嘛
So, brother, be my guest!

163
00:14:40,12 --> 00:14:40,91
我客气吗？
Your guest?

164
00:14:41,08 --> 00:14:41,87
客气呀
Go ahead!

165
00:14:42,04 --> 00:14:43,51
这还算客气？
You make me blush!

166
00:14:44,28 --> 00:14:45,99
你太客气啦
Well, do I?

167
00:14:46,16 --> 00:14:47,99
怎么才能不客气啊？
Then I must oblige.

168
00:14:48,80 --> 00:14:49,67
晚了！
We're late!

169
00:14:49,84 --> 00:14:50,59
前几任县长
Previous governors

170
00:14:50,76 --> 00:14:52,99
把鹅城的税，收到九十年以后了
have levied tax for the next 90 years!

171
00:14:53,16 --> 00:14:56,43
也就是西历二零一零年！
So everyone has paid up to 2010!

172
00:14:56,64 --> 00:14:57,99
咱们来错地方了
We've come to the wrong place!

173
00:14:58,32 --> 00:15:00,03
我倒是觉得这个地方不错
I like this town, though.

174
00:15:00,20 --> 00:15:03,03
百姓成穷鬼了，没油水可榨了
But people here have nothing left.

175
00:15:03,20 --> 00:15:05,66
老子从来就没想刮穷鬼的钱
I never take from the poor.

176
00:15:53,76 --> 00:15:55,03
那你要这么说
If you want to put it that way...

177
00:15:55,20 --> 00:15:57,43
买官当县长还真就是跪着要饭的
Many would love to be in your position,

178
00:15:57,64 --> 00:16:00,31
就这，多少人想跪还没这门路呢！
but few could afford to buy a post.

179
00:16:06,60 --> 00:16:12,31
我问问你，我为什么要上山当土匪？
Do you know why I became an outlaw?

180
00:16:14,56 --> 00:16:17,23
我就是腿脚不方便，跪不下去！
It's because my legs are not built for kneeling!

181
00:16:18,12 --> 00:16:19,71
原来你是想站着赚钱啊！
If you want to make money standing tall,

182
00:16:19,88 --> 00:16:21,23
那还是回山里吧
ride back to the mountains.

183
00:16:22,12 --> 00:16:23,75
这我就不明白了
I don't get this.

184
00:16:24,04 --> 00:16:25,59
我已经当了县长了
I am now governor,

185
00:16:25,76 --> 00:16:27,39
怎么还不如个土匪呀？
how can I be worse off than a bandit?

186
00:16:27,60 --> 00:16:29,27
百姓眼里，你是县长
You may be a governor to the townsfolk.

187
00:16:30,16 --> 00:16:31,91
可是黄四郎眼里
But in the eyes of Huang,

188
00:16:32,16 --> 00:16:33,79
你就是跪着要饭的
you're a mere beggar!

189
00:16:34,64 --> 00:16:37,91
赚钱嘛，生意，不寒酸！
This is only business. There is no shame.

190
00:16:38,08 --> 00:16:39,30
寒酸！
The hell there isn't!

191
00:16:39,72 --> 00:16:40,78
很寒酸
It's shameful!

192
00:16:40,92 --> 00:16:41,95
那你是想站着？
Do you prefer to stand tall,

193
00:16:42,12 --> 00:16:43,15
还是想赚钱呢？
or do you want to make money?

194
00:16:43,32 --> 00:16:46,07
我是想站着，还把钱赚了
I want to do both.

195
00:16:46,24 --> 00:16:46,91
赚不成！
No way.

196
00:16:47,08 --> 00:16:47,63
赚不成？
Why not?

197
00:16:47,84 --> 00:16:48,79
赚不成！
It's impossible.

198
00:16:50,20 --> 00:16:51,91
这个能不能赚钱？
Can I make money with this?

199
00:16:52,08 --> 00:16:53,63
能赚，山里
Yes, but only as a bandit.

200
00:16:54,44 --> 00:16:56,51
这个能不能赚钱？
Or with this?

201
00:16:56,68 --> 00:16:58,43
能赚，跪着
Yes, but only on your knees.

202
00:16:59,04 --> 00:17:00,39
这个加上这个
Combining the two,

203
00:17:00,60 --> 00:17:04,27
能不能站着把钱赚了？
can I make money standing tall?

204
00:17:05,32 --> 00:17:08,11
敢问九筒大哥何方神圣？
Mr. Nine, who exactly are you?

205
00:17:08,28 --> 00:17:11,15
鄙人，张麻子！
"Pocky" Zhang!

206
00:17:12,60 --> 00:17:14,03
那不是树，别砍了！
Stop it! This is not a tree!

207
00:17:15,08 --> 00:17:17,23
这是冤鼓，干隆那时候设的
It's an ancient magisterial drum!

208
00:17:17,40 --> 00:17:19,55
老没人敲就生了根，长了叶
Totally neglected,

209
00:06:12,64 --> 00:06:14,63
没人认识县长长什么模样
They've never met him.

210
00:06:14,80 --> 00:06:16,15
你干过几次？ 一年两次
- Done this before? - Twice a year.

211
00:06:16,28 --> 00:06:17,26
干过几年？ 八年
- Since when? - Eight years ago.

212
00:06:17,44 --> 00:06:20,51
八八六十四，你赚过六百四十万？
You've made more than $6.4 million?

213
00:07:06,80 --> 00:07:08,55
就看一眼
Just one look!

214
00:07:08,76 --> 00:07:10,23
师爷贵姓？ 别客气
- What's your name? - I...

215
00:07:10,40 --> 00:07:12,15
姓什么？ 姓汤
- What's your bloody name? - Tang.

216
00:07:12,32 --> 00:07:13,83
汤师爷，我当县长
I'll be the Governor,

217
00:07:14,00 --> 00:07:15,19
你继续当我的师爷
and you'll be my counselor!

218
00:07:15,36 --> 00:07:16,58
咱们鹅城走一趟
Let's go and rule Goose Town.

219
00:07:17,76 --> 00:07:19,55
夫人，要不要走一趟？
Ma'am, coming with us?

220
00:07:20,08 --> 00:07:21,35
走就走嘛
Well, why not?

221
00:07:21,56 --> 00:07:24,95
嘿嘿嘿，弟兄们上任鹅城
Brothers, let's move on to Goose Town!

222
00:07:25,12 --> 00:07:27,68
上任鹅城！
Goose Town here we come!

223
00:07:29,56 --> 00:07:30,54
兄弟们失了手
We've messed up badly.

224
00:07:30,72 --> 00:07:33,07
让你丈夫横遭了不测
End up drowning your husband.

225
00:07:33,40 --> 00:07:34,54
我很是愧疚
I feel bad about it.

226
00:07:34,72 --> 00:07:36,35
我已经第四次当寡妇了
I've already been widowed four times.

227
00:07:36,76 --> 00:07:38,23
那可千万别第五次哦！
Don't let there be a fifth time, then!

228
00:08:07,08 --> 00:08:08,27
当惯了县长
After serving as county governor,

229
00:08:08,40 --> 00:08:09,54
再回去当麻匪
I can't return to banditry.

230
00:08:09,72 --> 00:08:11,03
恐怕会有点不习’惯吧
I won't be able to handle it.

231
00:08:11,20 --> 00:08:12,99
曾经沧海难为水嘛
Once you've scaled Mount Everest...

232
00:08:13,16 --> 00:08:14,07
说得好
Such eloquence!

233
00:08:14,28 --> 00:08:15,26
那怎么办啊？
Then what should we do?

234
00:08:15,72 --> 00:08:16,91
“从正面绕回来，让大家乐一乐”
"Bring him back from the front for a laugh!"

235
00:08:17,96 --> 00:08:19,99
怎么办？继续当官叹！
We can continue to be civil servants!

236
00:08:20,68 --> 00:08:21,90
遇事要多动脑筋
Use your brain, not brawn.

237
00:08:22,08 --> 00:08:23,75
先动脑子后动手，明白吗？
Think twice before you make a move.

238
00:08:23,92 --> 00:08:25,06
明白
Got it.

239
00:08:30,24 --> 00:08:31,11
师爷
Counselor!

240
00:08:31,28 --> 00:08:33,31
我们现在是做官的人了
We're government officials now.

241
00:08:33,52 --> 00:08:34,74
不得再有匪气
We can't act like bandits!

242
00:08:34,92 --> 00:08:37,30
师爷，当县长最要紧的是什么？
What is a good governor's virtue?

243
00:08:37,52 --> 00:08:38,79
忍耐！
Forbearance.

244
00:08:40,32 --> 00:08:42,51

"Goose Town"

245
00:15:45,32 --> 00:15:46,23
当了县长
and play-act governor.

246
00:15:46,52 --> 00:15:47,74
我还得拉拢豪绅
I still have to play boot-licker to the rich,

247
00:15:47,92 --> 00:15:49,51
还得巧立名目
make up silly excuses,

248
00:15:49,84 --> 00:15:51,75
还得看他的脸色
and do things at his whim.

249
00:15:51,96 --> 00:15:53,55
我不成跪着要饭的了吗？
Doesn't that make me a beggar?

250
00:17:19,72 --> 00:17:20,83
就成现在这样了
it's taken root and sprouted leaves.

251
00:17:21,00 --> 00:17:22,11
我爹说了
Pop said to me,

252
00:17:22,28 --> 00:17:24,19
有冤鼓，就说明有冤！
we need this to convene court.

253
00:17:24,36 --> 00:17:25,83
他说他要判个案！
He wants to try a case.

254
00:17:25,96 --> 00:17:27,10
哪儿有冤呐？
What case?

255
00:17:27,72 --> 00:17:28,67
谁敢有冤呐？
Has someone filed a complaint?

256
00:17:28,84 --> 00:17:29,95
这都一百多年了
It's been here for 100 years.

257
00:17:30,12 --> 00:17:31,51
你要把它砍了，把鼓露出来
If you now unveil the drum,

258
00:17:31,68 --> 00:17:33,15
不定出多大冤呐？
who knows what case it may bring?

259
00:17:33,32 --> 00:17:35,39
别砍啦！你爹他人呢？
Where's your old man?

260
00:17:35,68 --> 00:17:36,55
睡觉！
In bed.

261
00:17:36,72 --> 00:17:38,87
跟谁睡啊？怎么还睡啊？
At this hour? Who with?

262
00:17:44,16 --> 00:17:45,30
鼓呢？
What happened?

263
00:17:45,88 --> 00:17:47,15
鼓呢？
Where is it going?

264
00:17:47,60 --> 00:17:49,87
叫你别砍吧，把鼓给砍跑了
Look what you've done!

265
00:17:50,00 --> 00:17:53,67
鼓鼓鼓鼓！
Drum...!

266
00:17:56,00 --> 00:17:56,98
躲开
Out of my way!

267
00:17:57,68 --> 00:17:59,43
这鼓怎么跟着我呀
It's homing in on me!

268
00:18:00,80 --> 00:18:04,23
救命呀…！大人
Help! Help!

269
00:18:31,36 --> 00:18:32,71
可惜了老子的酒
My wine is ruined,

270
00:18:32,92 --> 00:18:34,87
老子的雅兴全让你给毁了
my mood destroyed!

271
00:18:35,04 --> 00:18:36,18
全毁了！
Everything's spoilt!

272
00:18:36,80 --> 00:18:39,07
改日我再收拾你
I'll deal with you another day.

273
00:18:42,72 --> 00:18:44,07
鼓都捶破了
The drum is shattered!

274
00:18:45,20 --> 00:18:48,23
说明你们俩很冤呐
So there must be a case to try!

275
00:18:55,32 --> 00:18:56,38
升堂！
Court!

276
00:18:57,00 --> 00:18:58,95
冤从何来？
How have you been wronged?

277
00:19:00,00 --> 00:19:00,98
没冤！
I'm not.

278
00:19:02,92 --> 00:19:06,11
有冤的说冤，没冤的那就散！散会
If no one is wronged, case dismissed!

279
00:19:06,28 --> 00:19:08,19
冤！
Sir!

280
00:19:08,36 --> 00:19:10,71
不是我冤，是武举老爷冤！
I have wronged Master Wu.

281
00:19:10,88 --> 00:19:11,86
小的不长眼
I was careless.

282
00:19:12,04 --> 00:19:14,67
在躲鼓的时候碰洒了武举老爷的酒
I ran into him and knocked over his wine.

283
00:19:14,84 --> 00:19:16,55
害的武举老爷没有了胃口
Completely ruining his day.

284
00:19:16,72 --> 00:19:19,95
小的应该给武举老爷赔礼，赔礼
I need to kowtow and apologise. Sorry!

285
00:19:20,12 --> 00:19:21,18
老子不冤
That was nothing.

286
00:19:21,36 --> 00:19:22,95
敢说你不冤
How dare you say nothing?

287
00:19:23,40 --> 00:19:23,87
跪下！
Kneel!

288
00:19:24,04 --> 00:19:25,67
这可是黄四郎的团练教头
He coaches Huang's militia.

289
00:19:25,84 --> 00:19:26,23
跪不得
Go easy on him.

290
00:22:38,96 --> 00:22:40,63
那这个穆扎在哪儿？
Where's this Mozart?

291
00:22:40,80 --> 00:22:43,79
我留洋的时候要去哪找他？
How can I find him?

292
00:22:46,40 --> 00:22:50,59
他呀，离咱们很远
He is far away from us.

293
00:22:53,28 --> 00:22:54,83
怎么做，知道了吗？
Know what you have to do?

294
00:22:55,12 --> 00:22:55,67
知道了
Yes.

295
00:22:55,84 --> 00:22:58,43
谁让你去做的，你也知道了吗？
Who ordered you to do this?

296
00:22:58,76 --> 00:22:59,74
知道了
Who, sir?

297
00:23:01,20 --> 00:23:02,79
是老爷叫你去的吗？
Did I tell you to do it?

298
00:23:02,96 --> 00:23:04,99
是，是老爷让我去的
Yes, sir. You did.

299
00:08:02,44 --> 00:08:03,63
跟我们一块回山里吧
you must come and join our gang.

300
00:08:03,80 --> 00:08:04,91
你可以继续当我的母亲
Then you can continue to play mother.

301
00:08:05,08 --> 00:08:06,91
人往高处走，水往低处流！
One should always aim high.

302
00:11:44,36 --> 00:11:46,35
你说她怎么不害怕啊？
Why isn't she afraid?

303
00:11:47,44 --> 00:11:48,95
有点傻吧
She must be daft.

304
00:11:52,80 --> 00:11:54,67
为什么要枪毙麻匪？
Know why we shot these bandits?

305
00:11:54,84 --> 00:11:57,75
因为他们抢官车，劫县长！
It's because they ambushed the Governor.

306
00:11:57,92 --> 00:12:00,55
枪毙他们，就是为了让大家明白
Let this be a lesson to all!

307
00:43:40,32 --> 00:43:41,99
准！大哥
Exactly!

308
00:43:42,16 --> 00:43:43,51
我还在娘胎里的时候
A fortune teller told my mother

309
00:43:43,68 --> 00:43:45,75
算命先生就指着我娘的肚子说
before I was even born!

310
00:47:10,96 --> 00:47:12,95
是不是把县长给阉了？
I'll cut his balls off!

311
00:47:14,32 --> 00:47:16,27
钻石！…
Diamonds!

312
00:47:16,44 --> 00:47:18,74
我的两颗钻石！
My two diamonds!

313
00:47:18,92 --> 00:47:20,06
老爷放心！你要的钻石
Don't worry, sir!

314
00:47:20,24 --> 00:47:22,54
我这就给你弄回来
I'll retrieve your diamonds.

315
00:47:24,80 --> 00:47:25,35
对不起
I'm sorry.

316
00:47:25,56 --> 00:47:26,59
我应该的
My pleasure, sir.

317
00:47:26,76 --> 00:47:29,43
明白不明白，为什么派你去？
Know why I'm sending you?

318
00:47:29,64 --> 00:47:30,35
因为我死了
It's because I'm already dead.

319
00:47:30,56 --> 00:47:31,39
为什么你会死呢？
Do you know why?

320
00:47:31,60 --> 00:47:32,82
因为我把老爷给供出来了
I shouldn't have implicated you.

321
00:47:33,00 --> 00:47:37,39
对楼！如果你活着，早晚都会死
Right! If you are alive, you'll eventually die.

322
00:47:38,64 --> 00:47:40,35
如果你死了
But if you're dead,

323
00:43:45,92 --> 00:43:47,63
这孩子将来最大缺点
He said my Achilles heel

324
00:43:47,80 --> 00:43:49,55
就是不会装糊涂！
would be my inability to play act!

325
00:43:49,72 --> 00:43:51,35
大哥，我还能改吗？
Can I change it?

326
00:43:51,56 --> 00:43:53,31
改不了！天生的
No way! It's in your genes!

327
00:43:53,56 --> 00:43:56,39
你看看这位师爷就是装糊涂的高手
But our counselor is a born actor!

328
00:43:56,60 --> 00:43:58,79
把钱说成刀
Confusing dollar with dolls?

329
00:43:58,96 --> 00:44:00,10
钱，是什么钱？
What is dollar?

330
00:44:00,28 --> 00:44:02,58
是美元！
American money!

331
00:44:04,80 --> 00:44:07,59
你看你看！装糊涂的天才啊！
A genius when it comes to play acting.

332
00:44:07,76 --> 00:44:09,35
师爷，敬你的
Counselor, cheers!

333
00:44:10,76 --> 00:44:12,15
谢黄老爷颂扬
Thanks for your compliment, sir.

334
00:44:12,32 --> 00:44:14,35
容老弟真的糊涂一回
Allow me to play the fool for once.

335
00:44:14,56 --> 00:44:17,71
剿匪成功之后，追回的烟土
After defeating the bandits,

336
00:44:17,88 --> 00:44:19,83
我们只要两成就够！
we'll take just 20% of any opium recovered.

337
00:44:20,00 --> 00:44:21,95
不行！对半开！
No, I insist 50-50!

338
00:44:22,12 --> 00:44:24,75
为表诚意，预祝剿匪凯旋！
To show my sincerity,

339
00:44:24,92 --> 00:44:26,95
一百八十万，马上送来！
I'll send over $1.8 million now.

340
00:44:27,12 --> 00:44:29,91
无功不受禄，现在收钱太早
That's too soon. We haven't started yet!

341
00:44:30,08 --> 00:44:31,43
黛玉，晴雯！
Marie, Claire!

342
00:44:35,08 --> 00:44:37,43
大哥，美女我也不能要
Master, I can't take women.

343
00:44:37,64 --> 00:44:39,51
美女不要，钱你也不要
No interest in money or women,

344
00:44:39,68 --> 00:44:40,74
你要什么啊？
what do you want?

345
00:44:40,92 --> 00:44:42,11
腿！
A runner.

346
00:44:42,56 --> 00:44:43,54
什么腿啊？
What runner?

347
00:43:38,52 --> 00:43:40,15
你不会装糊涂
You don't know how to play act.

348
00:44:59,60 --> 00:45:02,23
明白，明白
I see, I see...

349
00:45:02,40 --> 00:45:03,75
我也明白
Yes, me too.

350
00:45:05,76 --> 00:45:07,11
该死的东西！
Stupid bitch!

351
00:45:13,00 --> 00:45:15,19
花有重开日
While flowers can blossom again,

352
00:45:15,36 --> 00:45:17,43
人无再少年
time lost will never return.

353
00:45:18,00 --> 00:45:19,99
姑娘如花似玉
This girl is as delicate as jade.

354
00:45:20,16 --> 00:45:22,54
大哥，怒不得啊！
Please don't be mad at her.

355
00:45:23,52 --> 00:45:25,55
黄老爷，轻松点！
Master Huang, easy easy...

356
00:45:37,52 --> 00:45:38,91
相见恨晚！
Shame we didn't meet until now!

357
00:45:39,08 --> 00:45:41,15
姑娘、钻石一并送上！
Diamonds, the girl - they're all yours.

358
00:12:00,72 --> 00:12:02,83
对抗官府之下场！
Never mess with the Governor!

359
00:12:03,00 --> 00:12:05,87
县长来了，鹅城太平了！
Hail the Governor!

360
00:12:06,04 --> 00:12:10,11
县长来了，青天就有啦！
Peace and justice is here!

361
00:12:16,00 --> 00:12:17,91
师爷，说得好啊
Great speech!

362
00:12:18,44 --> 00:12:19,66
你记得我跟你说过
Remember what I told you?

363
00:12:19,84 --> 00:12:21,79
有时候死人比活人有用吧
The dead can be really handy.

364
00:12:21,96 --> 00:12:23,75
是，死人是比活人有用
You're absolutely right.

365
00:12:32,12 --> 00:12:33,83
霸气外露！
Such arrogance!

366
00:12:34,00 --> 00:12:34,67
找死！
He's trouble.

367
00:12:34,84 --> 00:12:36,55
刚进城就开枪
A show of force!

368
00:12:36,76 --> 00:12:39,39
这不是二八开能打发走的
This one is a tricky customer!

369
00:12:40,44 --> 00:12:41,03
先发制人？
Should we strike first?

370
00:12:41,20 --> 00:12:42,03
不急
No hurry.

371
00:12:42,96 --> 00:12:43,87
跟他耍耍
Let's toy with him.

372
00:12:44,04 --> 00:12:45,39
不急，跟他耍耍
No hurry, let's toy with him!

373
00:12:45,60 --> 00:12:47,79
算了吧！
Cut it out!

374
00:12:55,12 --> 00:12:57,35
算了！
Cut it out!

375
00:12:57,56 --> 00:12:58,87
算了吧！
Cut it out! Cut it out!

376
00:12:59,04 --> 00:13:02,27
算了算了！


377
00:13:02,44 --> 00:13:06,35
算了吧！
Cut it out...

378
00:13:06,60 --> 00:13:08,83
算了！!
Cut it out!

379
00:13:10,20 --> 00:13:11,95
算了！!
Cut it out!

380
00:13:12,12 --> 00:13:13,59
算你妈的吧！
Cut the bloody hell out!

381
00:13:16,64 --> 00:13:17,27
胡千
Butler!

382
00:13:17,44 --> 00:13:18,63
是，老爷！
Yes sir!

383
00:13:19,20 --> 00:13:20,07
多拔他几颗牙
Take him to the dentist.

384
00:13:20,24 --> 00:13:21,91
跟我一样，全镶成金的
Fix him up with gold teeth like mine.

385
00:13:22,08 --> 00:13:23,06
是
Yes sir!

386
00:13:23,24 --> 00:13:24,07
夫人
Madam!

387
00:13:24,24 --> 00:13:25,63
兄弟我此番
The reason I am here,

388
00:13:26,40 --> 00:13:27,83
只为劫财
is to get rich,

389
00:13:28,24 --> 00:13:29,87
不为劫色
not to get laid.

390
00:13:31,96 --> 00:13:33,55
同床
We share a bed,

391
00:13:34,08 --> 00:13:35,71
但不入身！
but not our dreams.

392
00:13:37,08 --> 00:13:38,51
有枪在此
Here's a pistol.

393
00:13:39,92 --> 00:13:41,39
若是兄弟我…
Just in case,

394
00:13:41,88 --> 00:13:43,71
有冒犯夫人的举动
I overstep my mark,

395
00:13:44,52 --> 00:13:46,75
你可以随时干掉我
shoot me between the eyes.

396
00:20:24,16 --> 00:20:25,30
起来！不准跪！
Stand up everyone!

397
00:20:25,52 --> 00:20:28,67
皇上都没了，没人值得你们跪！
No one is worth kneeling to.

398
00:20:30,16 --> 00:20:31,83
我也不值你们跪！
Least of all to me!

399
00:20:32,08 --> 00:20:34,19
我来鹅城只办三件事
I've brought three things to Goose Town.

400
00:20:34,44 --> 00:20:36,90
公平！
Justice,

401
00:20:35,44 --> 00:20:36,91
justice,


402
00:20:37,08 --> 00:20:39,15
还是公平！
and goddamned justice.

403
00:20:39,32 --> 00:20:41,39
青天大老爷！
Hail, Governor!

404
00:20:41,60 --> 00:20:43,83
站起来！不准跪！
Stand up! No kneeling!

405
00:20:44,44 --> 00:20:46,79
这就对了
That's better.

406
00:20:48,28 --> 00:20:49,42
不准跪？
No kneeling?

407
00:20:49,64 --> 00:20:51,23
这哪是打我的屁股
He was not only flogging me,

408
00:20:51,40 --> 00:20:53,55
这明明是打您的脸
he was slapping you in the face!

409
00:20:56,92 --> 00:20:59,51
老爷，等我把屁股养好了
When my butts stop hurting,

410
00:20:59,68 --> 00:21:01,71
我亲手给你报仇！
I will personally avenge you.

411
00:21:01,88 --> 00:21:03,91
那就把卖凉粉的叫来
Summon the noodle vendor.

412
00:21:04,88 --> 00:21:06,75
县长喜欢判案
If our governor loves to try,

413
00:21:06,92 --> 00:21:10,35
就安排一点案子给他判叹
we'll give him a case to try.

414
00:45:41,32 --> 00:45:43,31
唉！我带夫人来的
I've brought my wife with me.

415
00:45:43,52 --> 00:45:44,99
再收姑娘不方便
So I can't take her home.

416
00:45:45,16 --> 00:45:46,51
那钻石送夫人
Then take the diamonds for your wife.

417
00:45:46,68 --> 00:45:48,35
好！我先替她收着
I accept them on her behalf.

418
00:45:49,64 --> 00:45:50,67
起来吧
Get up.

419
00:45:51,92 --> 00:45:54,87
不是黛玉和晴雯吗？
I thought you'd summoned two girls.

420
00:45:55,04 --> 00:45:57,07
怎么就来了一名女子？
How come there's only her?

421
00:45:57,24 --> 00:45:59,87
莫非她就叫黛玉晴雯？
You mean she is Marie-Claire?

422
00:46:00,04 --> 00:46:01,35
说你不会装糊涂吧
You are really naive!

423
00:46:01,56 --> 00:46:03,19
起了个东洋名字
She's adopted a fashionable name.

424
00:46:03,36 --> 00:46:06,43
黛玉晴雯子！
It's Marie-Claire!

425
00:46:08,32 --> 00:46:10,15
全死了！
There goes the last of them!

426
00:52:35,60 --> 00:52:37,03
为什么朝我床上开枪？
Why did you target my bed?

427
00:52:37,20 --> 00:52:39,76
黄老爷说你霸气外露
Master said you're arrogant,

428
00:52:39,96 --> 00:52:40,94
危险！
a threat!

429
00:52:41,64 --> 00:52:43,55
回去给他带个话，告诉他
Take him a message:

430
00:52:43,72 --> 00:52:45,75
他喜欢让人假死这一套
While he likes people to fake death,

431
00:52:45,92 --> 00:52:49,35
正好，我也喜欢让人多死几回这一套
I'm fond of killing people more than once!

432
00:48:42,84 --> 00:48:45,91
贱货，骚货，妹子，贱货！
Whore! Bitch! Vixen! Tramp!

433
00:48:46,88 --> 00:48:47,63
就是时间不够
If I'd more time,

434
00:48:47,80 --> 00:48:50,43
要不然我活活把你给搞死了！
I'll put you in your place!

435
00:48:50,64 --> 00:48:51,78
好啊，来呀
Come on!

436
00:48:52,16 --> 00:48:53,43
看你怎么办
I dare you!

437
00:48:56,04 --> 00:48:57,75
你就只剩下一张嘴！
You're all talk!

438
00:48:58,12 --> 00:49:00,15
写几个烂戏本的老色鬼！
A perverted, dirty old man.

439
00:49:00,32 --> 00:49:01,38
不是我出钱
Could you have bought the post

440
00:49:01,60 --> 00:49:03,03
谁给你买官当县长啊？
without my money?

441
00:49:03,20 --> 00:49:04,79
你别逼急我了
Don't piss me off!

442
00:49:05,04 --> 00:49:07,03
我还真觉得那个土匪挺有本事的
I think the bandit is more able!

443
00:49:07,72 --> 00:49:08,75
他算什么本事啊？
What do you mean?

444
00:49:08,92 --> 00:49:09,87
比你有本事
He's got more balls than you!

445
00:49:10,04 --> 00:49:11,87
早烂醉如泥了
He's good at getting drunk!

446
00:49:17,00 --> 00:49:20,03
这才是真本事
These will make your day!

447
00:50:54,68 --> 00:50:56,75
杀了你，我还怎么睡啊
I don't sleep with dead bodies!

448
00:51:02,76 --> 00:51:07,15
我不能酒后欺负一个寡妇
I won't take drunken advantage of a widow,

449
00:51:08,12 --> 00:51:09,87
是跟你睡
so I'll just sleep next to you,

450
00:51:10,88 --> 00:51:12,83
不是睡你
not with you!

451
00:52:00,36 --> 00:52:02,03
我居然上了你们的当！
Holy smoke! I was fooled!

452
00:52:02,20 --> 00:52:04,07
你和武举人都是假死是吧？
You and Wu both faked death!

453
00:52:04,24 --> 00:52:04,99
不错
That's right.

454
00:52:05,16 --> 00:52:05,95
为什么冒充麻匪？
Why dressed up as a bandit?

455
00:52:06,12 --> 00:52:08,42
老子就是麻匪，张麻子是我大哥
I'm a bandit. "Pocky" Zhang's my boss!

456
00:52:08,64 --> 00:52:10,19
那你是老几呀？
What's your rank, then?

457
00:52:10,36 --> 00:52:11,03
老三
I am Three!

458
00:52:11,20 --> 00:52:12,75
老三，你出名了
Three, you've hit big time!

459
00:52:12,92 --> 00:52:13,71
有人冒充你了！
You've got yourself a fake!

460
00:52:13,88 --> 00:52:15,67
别听他废话了，大哥
Chief, don't listen to his bullshit!

461
00:52:15,84 --> 00:52:17,03
六子就死在他手上
He plotted Six's death.

462
00:52:17,20 --> 00:52:18,11
你让我一枪崩了他
Let me shoot him now!

463
00:52:18,28 --> 00:52:18,91
大哥？
Chief?

464
00:52:19,08 --> 00:52:20,71
是你大哥张麻子派你来的
Were you sent by "Pocky" Zhang?

465
00:52:20,88 --> 00:52:22,39
还是你老爷黄四郎派你来的？
Or by Master Huang?

466
00:52:22,60 --> 00:52:23,74
不能说错啊！
I want the right answer!

467
00:52:25,20 --> 00:52:26,67
黄老爷 为什么？
- Master Huang. - Why?

468
00:52:26,84 --> 00:52:28,95
他让我们假扮麻匪在城里抢劫
We commit crimes posing as bandits,

469
00:52:29,40 --> 00:52:30,91
他逼县长下令剿匪
forcing governors to launch expeditions.

470
00:46:10,32 --> 00:46:11,87
师爷，高！
A wise counselor!

471
00:46:12,64 --> 00:46:14,23
县长，硬！
A tough governor!

472
00:46:14,52 --> 00:46:17,08
黄老爷又高又硬！
Master, you're both wise and tough.

473
00:46:17,84 --> 00:46:19,99
你到底是不是张麻子？
Are you really "Pocky" Zhang?

474
00:46:21,24 --> 00:46:22,79
要说你是吧
Supposing that you are.

475
00:46:23,80 --> 00:46:25,39
扭断刘都统大腿
You've already made a fortune

476
00:46:25,60 --> 00:46:26,82
赚那么多钱
from "crippling" Liu's runners.

477
00:46:27,16 --> 00:46:30,31
何苦进城当县长呢？
Why bother with Goose Town?

478
00:46:32,32 --> 00:46:34,70
要说你不是吧…
But if you are someone else...

479
00:46:36,24 --> 00:46:37,55
恩人？
Saviour?

480
00:46:55,64 --> 00:46:57,91
今晚，杀鸡取卵！
Kill the chicken and take the eggs.

481
00:46:58,08 --> 00:47:00,35
一定要在县长的床上
Let him die in his own bed.

482
00:47:01,20 --> 00:47:03,95
不要让人以为吃了我的饭
Don't kill him on his way home

483
00:47:04,12 --> 00:47:07,03
死在我家里，死在半路上
after dining as my guest.

484
00:47:07,20 --> 00:47:08,11
明白！
Understood!

485
00:47:08,28 --> 00:47:09,07
哪个是鸡？
Who is the "chicken"?

486
00:47:09,24 --> 00:47:09,87
县长！
The Governor.

487
00:47:10,04 --> 00:47:10,79
那么卵呢？
And the "eggs"?

488
00:49:32,12 --> 00:49:33,23
给你报仇
and avenge your death.

489
00:49:34,88 --> 00:49:36,79
可是中途我改了主意
But I've changed my mind.

490
00:49:38,32 --> 00:49:40,95
鱼死网破报不了仇
I can't take revenge this way.

491
00:49:42,16 --> 00:49:44,39
弟兄们不能再死人了
I can't risk more lives.

492
00:49:44,60 --> 00:49:46,31
大哥，你怎么在这儿啊？
Chief, we're looking for you.

493
00:49:46,52 --> 00:49:47,79
你怎么让我们撤了呀？
Why did you signal retreat?

494
00:49:47,96 --> 00:49:49,79
黄四郎听见你们吹的哨声
Huang heard your whistling.

495
00:49:49,92 --> 00:49:51,75
我就绝对安全了
I knew that I was safe.

496
00:49:52,20 --> 00:49:55,11
去吧，我跟六子单独待会儿
Leave, I want to spend time alone with Six.

497
00:49:57,40 --> 00:49:58,71
今天我算明白了
It has finally dawned on me,

498
00:49:59,88 --> 00:50:03,03
为什么当初我会上山当麻匪
why I became a bandit in the first place.

499
00:50:03,60 --> 00:50:06,06
就是因为跟这帮东西玩不起
I was no match for these people.

500
00:50:06,40 --> 00:50:09,51
现在为了你，我必须玩得起
But I must take them on at their own game now,

501
00:50:10,64 --> 00:50:11,83
还得玩得赢
and to win for you.

502
00:50:19,68 --> 00:50:20,51
谁？
What the heck?

503
00:50:23,64 --> 00:50:26,39
偷我的钻石！
You stole my diamonds.

504
00:50:27,28 --> 00:50:28,71
这石头是给你的吗？
They're not meant for you.

505
00:50:28,88 --> 00:50:30,95
是给县长夫人的
They're a gift for Mrs. Governor!

506
00:50:31,12 --> 00:50:33,63
咱们俩谁是县长？
Which of us is the Governor?

507
00:50:36,72 --> 00:50:37,94
谁是县长？
Who's the Governor?

508
00:50:39,16 --> 00:50:42,43
我问你呢，谁是县长？
Tell me who's the Governor!

509
00:50:42,64 --> 00:50:44,31
你是要杀我？
You want to kill me?

510
00:50:44,64 --> 00:50:45,95
还是要睡我？
Or to sleep with me?

511
00:50:47,60 --> 00:50:48,71
有什么不一样吗？
Is there a difference?

512
00:50:48,88 --> 00:50:49,99
不一样啊！
It's different!

513
00:50:50,16 --> 00:50:52,31
那就先睡，再杀
I can bed you first, and kill you later.

514
00:50:53,08 --> 00:50:54,43
那还是杀了我吧
Then you'd better kill me now.

515
00:52:49,56 --> 00:52:50,75
您要放我回去？
Letting me off again?

516
00:52:50,96 --> 00:52:52,39
只有你的话他听得懂
He can only understand words you say.

517
00:52:52,60 --> 00:52:53,87
大哥，可您到底是？
Chief, you're...

518
00:52:54,04 --> 00:52:55,67
不错，张麻子！
Yes, "Pocky" Zhang.

519
00:44:43,72 --> 00:44:47,67
江湖豪情，侠胆柔肠之大腿
Master Huang's a runner of exceptional courage!

520
00:44:48,08 --> 00:44:48,95
哥！ 弟！
- Brother! - Brother!

521
00:44:49,12 --> 00:44:50,75
你的腿，就是我的腿
We can run side by side!

522
00:44:50,92 --> 00:44:52,63
你的腿，就是我的命
We'll run for our lives!

523
00:44:52,80 --> 00:44:55,63
有道是，江湖本无路
Roads won't exist in this world of chaos,

524
00:44:55,80 --> 00:44:58,63
有了腿，便有了路！
unless people like us run on them!

525
00:47:41,00 --> 00:47:42,59
你永远都活着
you may live on forever!

526
00:47:42,76 --> 00:47:43,71
明白
Understood.

527
00:47:43,96 --> 00:47:46,11
杀鸡取卵！
Kill the chicken, take the eggs!

528
00:47:46,80 --> 00:47:47,94
师爷，大哥呢？
Where's Chief?

529
00:47:48,12 --> 00:47:49,18
马上，喝醉了
Punch drunk!

530
00:47:49,36 --> 00:47:50,67
人呢？哪儿呢？
Where is he?

531
00:47:50,80 --> 00:47:52,79
刚才还说话呢！
We're still chatting just now!

532
00:47:53,16 --> 00:47:54,22
我也喝醉了
I must be drunk, too!

533
00:47:54,40 --> 00:47:54,95
回来跟你算帐
I'll sort you out later.

534
00:47:55,12 --> 00:47:58,66
没在马上么？是不是掉路上了？
He must've fallen off the horse.

535
00:48:05,00 --> 00:48:07,23
听说你睡觉了
I heard that you slept.

536
00:48:09,00 --> 00:48:10,87
你抬起头来跟我说话
Look up when you speak.

537
00:48:11,36 --> 00:48:13,51
听说你昨天睡觉了
I heard that you slept last night.

538
00:48:13,72 --> 00:48:16,15
我哪天不睡觉啊！
I sleep every goddamned night!

539
00:48:16,52 --> 00:48:17,66
你看着我说话
Look at me when you speak.

540
00:48:17,84 --> 00:48:20,43
听说你跟土匪睡觉了
You slept with the bandit?

541
00:48:20,64 --> 00:48:23,71
睡了！你不想知道我们怎么睡的吗？
Do you want a blow-by-blow account?

542
00:48:23,84 --> 00:48:25,23
对，怎么睡的？
Tell me more.

543
00:48:25,40 --> 00:48:28,27
一个青楼女子，跟一个土匪头子
When a seasoned pro meets a bandit chief,

544
00:48:28,44 --> 00:48:31,23
什么睡法都能有
anything could happen!

545
00:48:34,68 --> 00:48:36,03
嘘什么嘘？
What now?

546
00:48:38,64 --> 00:48:41,59
你这个不要脸的骚窑姐，妹子，贱货
Whore! Bitch! Vixen! Tramp!

547
00:48:41,84 --> 00:48:42,71
你说什么！
What did you call me?

548
00:57:30,12 --> 00:57:32,35
千爷，别打了
Butler, hold your fire!

549
00:57:32,56 --> 00:57:34,35
赶紧回去备银子吧！
We need time to prepare the ransom.

550
00:53:29,76 --> 00:53:31,11
她是我老婆！
She was my wife.

551
00:53:31,28 --> 00:53:33,15
我是县长！ 让他进来
- I am the governor! - Let him in.

552
00:53:33,32 --> 00:53:35,88
我就是马邦德！
I am Ma Bangde!

553
00:53:38,92 --> 00:53:41,38
县长如何了？县长如何了？
Is the Governor okay?

554
00:53:41,60 --> 00:53:43,83
你们追！一个麻匪也不能跑！
Give chase! Don't let anyone get away.

555
00:53:48,72 --> 00:53:50,67
天杀的麻匪
Those goddamned bandits!

556
00:53:50,84 --> 00:53:52,71
伤天害理
Scum of the earth!

557
00:53:53,04 --> 00:53:57,03
县长刚刚上任，竟和他的夫人双双…
The Governor has only just arrived...

558
00:54:02,04 --> 00:54:04,71
我说我当不了这个县长！
Said I didn't want to be a governor,

559
00:54:04,88 --> 00:54:08,99
你非得给我花钱买这个官！
but you still bought me this post!

560
00:54:10,16 --> 00:54:13,43
现在官倒是到手了
The governership is now mine,

561
00:54:14,60 --> 00:54:17,67
你倒这么走了！
but you've left me on my own.

562
00:54:20,44 --> 00:54:21,99
她是我老婆！
She was my wife.

563
00:54:22,80 --> 00:54:24,07
我就是县长
I am the governor!

564
00:54:24,24 --> 00:54:26,43
我就是马邦德！
I am Ma Bangde!

565
00:54:27,00 --> 00:54:30,19
你呀，太年轻了
You're too hot-headed.

566
00:21:10,72 --> 00:21:14,03
爹，今天你这县长干得真漂亮
Pop, you were brilliant today.

567
00:21:14,20 --> 00:21:15,87
打武举人打得真过瘾
Flogging that martial scholar was a hoot!

568
00:21:16,28 --> 00:21:17,59
将来我也想当县长
I'd love to be a governor one day.

569
00:21:17,76 --> 00:21:21,07
你不能当县长，也不许当土匪
I don't want you to be a bandit or politician.

570
00:21:22,88 --> 00:21:25,87
你爹死的时候把你交给我
When your father entrusted you to me,

571
00:21:26,56 --> 00:21:29,02
我答应过他，要让你有出息
I promised I'd raise you properly.

572
00:21:29,20 --> 00:21:31,95
那我当什么才有出息？
Then what should I do?

573
00:21:34,04 --> 00:21:37,35
当学生！读书，多听这个
Study and learn to enjoy this.

574
00:21:37,76 --> 00:21:38,90
没声啊！
There is no sound!

575
00:24:10,36 --> 00:24:12,03
我不能…
Then I must not...

576
00:24:12,20 --> 00:24:14,63
让她再守活寡
Ieave her alone uncomforted.

577
00:24:21,84 --> 00:24:23,43
这是第一步
That's my first move.

578
00:24:23,88 --> 00:24:24,71
三步之内…
Within three...

579
00:24:24,88 --> 00:24:27,44
要不让他们滚蛋走人
they'll either leave with tails between their legs,

580
00:24:27,68 --> 00:24:29,11
要不让他们跪下当狗！
or stay and become our poodles!

581
00:24:29,28 --> 00:24:32,23
对，非常对
Right, absolutely right.

582
00:24:33,76 --> 00:24:35,11
老爷，您找我？
You're looking for me, sir?

583
00:24:35,28 --> 00:24:36,79
官府的人还没来？
Have you entertained our new officials yet?

584
00:24:36,96 --> 00:24:37,75
没有
Not yet.

585
00:24:37,92 --> 00:24:39,06
县长不缥妓？
The Governor doesn't frequent brothels?

586
00:24:39,28 --> 00:24:42,39
不好色的县长，不一定是好县长
He'll never make a good governor.

587
00:24:42,60 --> 00:24:43,91
我就是不好色！
I don't indulge much in sex.

588
00:24:44,08 --> 00:24:45,79
所以您当不了县长
So you won't make a good governor either.

589
00:24:49,20 --> 00:24:50,67
我当不了县长？
Why is that so?

590
00:24:50,84 --> 00:24:52,67
县长哪能跟您比呀
The two bear no comparison!

591
00:24:52,84 --> 00:24:54,39
他只是流水的县长
Governors come and go.

592
00:24:54,60 --> 00:24:56,59
您才是铁打的老爷
But you, sir, will always be our godfather!

593
00:24:59,76 --> 00:25:01,91
你真会讲话
You speak well!

594
00:25:02,16 --> 00:25:04,75
他们一定会来，你要好好记住
I'm sure they will come.

595
00:25:04,92 --> 00:25:07,63
他们讲的每一句有用的话
Eavesdrop their every conversation,

596
00:25:07,80 --> 00:25:10,75
都要回来跟我汇报
report their every move.

597
00:25:10,96 --> 00:25:11,63
是
Yes.

598
00:25:11,80 --> 00:25:15,11
走吧，你不要变成小凤仙哦
Go now. Just don't become a Mata Hari!

599
00:25:16,08 --> 00:25:18,75
老爷，谁是小凤仙？
Who's Mata Hari, Master?

600
00:25:19,08 --> 00:25:21,95
小凤仙都不知道还当妓女
What kind of whore are you?

601
00:25:22,12 --> 00:25:26,35
那可是名震京城，誉满全国的妓女
She's the world's most infamous double agent!

602
00:25:32,24 --> 00:25:33,30
你们出去吧
You two can leave.

603
00:25:36,92 --> 00:25:41,31
县长此刻正怀抱夫人，共枕同眠
Now the Governor is in bed with his wife.

604
00:25:42,72 --> 00:25:44,79
让他睡最后一个安稳觉
Let him enjoy one more night in peace!

605
00:25:45,12 --> 00:25:48,03
县长公子，以身试法
The Governor's boy is in trouble,

606
00:25:48,20 --> 00:25:50,66
讲茶大堂，恭迎大驾！
your presence is requested at the teahouse.

607
00:25:50,84 --> 00:25:53,14
讲茶大堂？县衙不是判案的地方吗？
Why don't they convene at the magistracy?

608
00:25:53,32 --> 00:25:54,67
你这个县衙是摆设
The magistracy is just for show.

609
00:25:54,84 --> 00:25:57,95
判案只有去讲茶大堂！那才是真县衙！
All cases are tried at the teahouse.

610
00:25:59,20 --> 00:26:00,39
六爷
Master Six,

611
00:26:01,16 --> 00:26:02,43
你吃了两碗的粉
you've eaten two bowls of jelly,

612
00:15:05,84 --> 00:15:07,79
不刮穷鬼的钱你收谁的呀？
Who are your victims, then?

613
00:15:07,96 --> 00:15:09,51
谁有钱赚谁的
The rich, of course.

614
00:15:09,72 --> 00:15:10,55
当过县长吗？
Ever been a Governor?

615
00:15:10,72 --> 00:15:11,59
没有
No.

616
00:15:11,76 --> 00:15:12,98
我告诉你！
Listen carefully!

617
00:15:13,16 --> 00:15:15,39
县长上任，得巧立名目
You have to devise ways to raise money,

618
00:15:15,60 --> 00:15:17,63
拉拢豪绅，缴税捐款
Make the rich pay first,

619
00:15:17,80 --> 00:15:20,59
他们交了，才能让百姓跟着交钱
townsfolk will follow suit.

620
00:15:20,76 --> 00:15:23,87
得钱之后，豪绅的钱如数奉还
Then reimburse the rich with what they paid,

621
00:15:24,04 --> 00:15:26,42
百姓的钱，三七分成！
and split the rest 30-70!

622
00:15:26,64 --> 00:15:27,75
怎么才七成啊？
We only get 70?

623
00:15:27,88 --> 00:15:29,59
七成是人家的！
No, the rich get 70.

624
00:15:29,76 --> 00:15:32,39
能得三成还得看黄四郎的脸色
We get 30 at Huang's discretion.

625
00:15:32,60 --> 00:15:33,31
谁的脸色？
At whose discretion?

626
00:15:33,52 --> 00:15:34,58
他！
Him.

627
00:15:34,76 --> 00:15:35,39
他？!
Him?

628
00:15:35,60 --> 00:15:37,19
我大老远的来一趟
I come all this way,

629
00:15:37,36 --> 00:15:40,15
就是为了看他的脸色？
only to become his running dog?

630
00:15:40,36 --> 00:15:41,42
对！
Correct.

631
00:15:42,96 --> 00:15:45,15
我好不容易劫了趟火车
It's hard enough robbing your train,

632
00:19:26,40 --> 00:19:27,99
老子是光绪三十一年
During the reign of the last Emperor,

633
00:19:28,16 --> 00:19:29,63
皇上钦点的武举人
I was bestowed a Martial Scholar.

634
00:19:29,80 --> 00:19:31,59
论官职，比你官大
My rank was higher than yours.

635
00:19:31,76 --> 00:19:33,79
你应该给老子跪下
You should kneel in front of me!

636
00:19:33,96 --> 00:19:35,15
跪下！
Kneel!

637
00:19:36,28 --> 00:19:37,59
跪不跪？
Kneel!

638
00:19:37,84 --> 00:19:39,95
还皇上！
This is bullshit!

639
00:19:40,40 --> 00:19:42,63
哪个皇上？我见过吗？
The last Emperor? Have I ever met him?

640
00:19:42,80 --> 00:19:43,99
你要是个文举人
If you'd been a Literary Scholar,

641
00:19:44,16 --> 00:19:45,63
他应该给你磕两百个头
he'd have to kowtow 200 times.

642
00:19:45,80 --> 00:19:48,43
可惜你只是个武举人
But as a Martial Scholar,

643
00:19:48,64 --> 00:19:50,67
他只能给你磕一百个头
you'll get only 100 kowtows.

644
00:19:50,96 --> 00:19:53,11
现在他两百个头磕完了
Since he has already done 200,

645
00:19:53,28 --> 00:19:54,07
你还他一百个
you've to return 100 kowtows.

646
00:19:54,24 --> 00:19:55,03
可我只磕了两个
But I've only kowtowed twice!

647
00:19:55,20 --> 00:19:57,43
两个也得还你一百个
Does it really matter?

648
00:29:14,32 --> 00:29:15,30
才能让我看得见
so that we can all see.

649
00:29:15,52 --> 00:29:18,19
六爷，让大家看看是一碗还是两碗
Show us if there is one or two bowls.

650
00:29:18,36 --> 00:29:19,75
拉！
Out with it!

651
00:29:23,72 --> 00:29:25,71
六爷，碗！
Here's a bowl, sir.

652
00:29:36,92 --> 00:29:39,59
看见了吧！看见了吧！
See! Can you see?

653
00:29:39,88 --> 00:29:42,87
是不是只有一碗！
One bowl!

654
00:29:41,32 --> 00:29:42,87
There's only one bowl, right?


655
00:27:29,12 --> 00:27:30,75
你早说不就得了吗
Let's be frank.

656
00:27:30,92 --> 00:27:31,90
他要个公平
He wants to be treated fairly.

657
00:27:32,08 --> 00:27:34,35
你不是欺负老实人吗？
It's wrong to bully a commoner.

658
00:27:43,72 --> 00:27:46,18
告诉我，你是老实人吗？
Are you an honest person?

659
00:27:46,44 --> 00:27:46,95
我是
Yes, I am...

660
00:27:47,12 --> 00:27:49,27
那你就说实话，我到底吃了几碗粉？
How many bowls did I eat?

661
00:27:49,44 --> 00:27:50,91
你告诉他！
Tell him!

662
00:27:51,28 --> 00:27:52,55
你说不说？
Speak up!

663
00:27:53,08 --> 00:27:56,95
拿枪吓唬一可怜的，卖凉粉的
Stop threatening this poor man with a gun!

664
00:27:57,12 --> 00:28:00,15
有枪是吧？谁没有枪啊！
Who doesn't carry a gun around here?

665
00:28:01,28 --> 00:28:02,55
孙守义
Noodle vendor!

666
00:28:03,00 --> 00:28:05,63
大声说，他吃了几碗
How many bowls did he eat?

667
00:28:09,04 --> 00:28:11,75
守义，在座所有的乡亲
Everyone in this teahouse,

668
00:28:11,92 --> 00:28:15,27
都会为你和你的家人作主的
will bear witness on your behalf.

669
00:28:15,60 --> 00:28:18,23
大声说，几碗
Speak up! How many?

670
00:28:25,12 --> 00:28:26,26
两碗
Two bowls.

671
00:28:34,56 --> 00:28:35,87
你是一个恶人！
You're nasty!

672
00:28:36,96 --> 00:28:39,95
比恶是吧，我比你还恶
But I dare you to match me!

673
00:28:43,88 --> 00:28:45,51
都看好了啊
Take a good look!

674
00:28:45,68 --> 00:28:47,91
今我肚子里要有两碗粉
If there are two bowls of jelly in me,

675
00:28:48,08 --> 00:28:49,03
我白死
I'll die!

676
00:30:14,92 --> 00:30:16,83
杀了他，六子白死
Don't let Six die in vain!

677
00:30:17,00 --> 00:30:19,63
我没有杀他，他自己捅自己的！
I didn't do it. He stabbed himself.

678
00:30:19,80 --> 00:30:20,75
我们在打赌
We'd a wager.

679
00:30:20,92 --> 00:30:21,90
他输了
He lost.

680
00:30:22,16 --> 00:30:23,63
大哥，你让我一枪崩了他！
Let me blast his head off!

681
00:30:23,80 --> 00:30:25,75
你不敢杀我！你不能杀我！
You wouldn't dare! You can't do it.

682
00:30:25,92 --> 00:30:27,87
黄四郎就想看你这样！
Huang is provoking you.

683
00:30:28,04 --> 00:30:29,23
一脸的败相！
He wants you to lose your head.

684
00:30:29,40 --> 00:30:31,19
杀了他就是输，不杀还能赢
We'll lose if we kill him now.

685
00:30:31,36 --> 00:30:32,07
放人
Let him go.

686
00:30:32,24 --> 00:30:34,75
杀人诛心，杀人诛心！
You must destroy Huang's soul!

687
00:30:34,92 --> 00:30:36,55
师爷说得对 放人
- Pop, he's right. - Let him go!

688
00:30:43,52 --> 00:30:48,11
刀进了肚子，那凉粉还是凉粉？
He stabbed himself? What about the jelly?

689
00:30:48,28 --> 00:30:49,31
是
Yes

690
00:30:50,12 --> 00:30:50,51
不是
and no...

691
00:30:50,68 --> 00:30:53,71
我就想知道，凉粉到底还是不是凉粉
Tell me if it was still jelly.

692
00:30:53,88 --> 00:30:54,55
是凉粉！
Yes, it was.

693
00:30:54,72 --> 00:30:56,07
过来过来
Come over here.

694
00:30:57,52 --> 00:30:58,66
那么…
And...

695
00:30:58,96 --> 00:30:59,94
人死了？
is he dead?

696
00:31:00,20 --> 00:31:01,51
死了
Yes.

697
00:31:03,52 --> 00:31:05,82
所以…你就把我供出来了？
Did you implicate me?

698
00:31:06,00 --> 00:31:07,79
我是用老爷的名字吓唬他们
I did invoke your name.

699
00:31:07,96 --> 00:31:09,18
他们被吓着了么？
Were they scared?

700
00:31:09,36 --> 00:31:11,79
他们说杀人诛心！
They said to kill, a person's soul must first be destroyed.

701
00:31:11,96 --> 00:31:15,27
杀人还要诛心？
Murder? Soul destruction?

702
00:31:15,72 --> 00:31:18,15
好可怕啊！
How awful.

703
00:31:22,28 --> 00:31:24,79
六弟，四哥发誓替你报仇！
Brother, I vow to avenge you!

704
00:31:31,72 --> 00:31:34,35
六弟，五哥发誓替你报仇！
Brother, I swear I'll avenge you!

705
00:31:40,00 --> 00:31:42,30
六哥，七弟发誓替你报仇！
Brother, I vow to avenge you!

706
00:31:42,52 --> 00:31:44,98
二哥喝醉了，他让我带话
Two is drunk. I am pledging for him.

707
00:31:45,16 --> 00:31:46,91
二哥发誓替你报仇！
He will avenge your death, too.

708
00:31:53,32 --> 00:31:56,31
六弟，三哥发誓替你报仇！
Brother, I swear to avenge you!

709
00:31:56,68 --> 00:31:58,79
二哥没喝醉，他生气了！
Two is sober, he's just pissed off!

710
00:31:59,20 --> 00:32:00,75
大哥不想让大伙拼命
Chief doesn't want to risk our lives.

711
00:32:00,92 --> 00:32:02,91
命都不拼，还算麻匪吗？
Are we boy scouts or what?

712
00:20:13,20 --> 00:20:15,79
你磕头！你数数！
You kowtow, and you do the counting.

713
00:20:16,24 --> 00:20:21,91
一二三四五六…
One, two, three, four...

714
00:20:22,08 --> 00:20:23,99
青天大老爷！
Hail, Governor!

715
00:21:39,88 --> 00:21:42,11
这帮买官的县长，就知道捞钱
Politicians only know how to bully.

716
00:54:30,64 --> 00:54:33,35
不该一进城就枪毙麻匪
You shouldn't have shot those bandits.

717
00:54:33,60 --> 00:54:36,83
他们一定会报复你的
They'll take revenge for sure.

718
00:54:37,68 --> 00:54:39,71
不哭，不哭
Don't cry.

719
00:54:39,88 --> 00:54:42,07
她是为鹅城死的
She died for Goose Town.

720
00:54:42,40 --> 00:54:44,91
得厚葬她呀
She deserves a proper burial!

721
00:54:46,96 --> 00:54:50,07
得让所有的乡绅都过来
Invite every townsfolk to attend.

722
00:56:59,76 --> 00:57:00,67
有粗有细啊！
I am impressed!

723
00:57:00,84 --> 00:57:02,71
三天之内，钱不到就撕票！
We'll kill the hostages in 3 days!

724
00:57:02,88 --> 00:57:05,55
记着，我是九筒！
Remember, I am Nine!

725
00:57:08,40 --> 00:57:09,95
这活办的真爽快！
That was quite a show.

726
00:57:10,12 --> 00:57:11,51
像真的吗？ 像！
- Almost pass for real! - Sure.

727
00:57:11,68 --> 00:57:14,19
要是有人再流点血就更像真的了！
It'll be more convincing with some blood.

728
00:57:14,36 --> 00:57:15,34
对！
Right!

729
00:57:16,84 --> 00:57:18,19
有这个必要吗？
Was that necessary?

730
00:57:18,36 --> 00:57:20,71
有这个必要吗？有这个必要吗？
Was that really necessary?

731
00:57:28,24 --> 00:57:29,95
给我打！给我狠狠打！
Shoot! Give them hell!

732
00:49:20,32 --> 00:49:24,02
六子，黄四郎今天死了三条狗
Three of Huang's dogs died today.

733
00:49:24,96 --> 00:49:28,19
我知道，狗命抵不了你的命
I know they're not worthy of you.

734
00:49:28,56 --> 00:49:29,62
我本来带着弟兄们
I was going to lead our brothers,

735
00:49:29,80 --> 00:49:31,95
要跟黄四郎拼个鱼死网破
engage Huang in a deadly duel,

736
00:55:04,96 --> 00:55:10,08

"Master Six rests here in peace"

737
00:55:10,28 --> 00:55:13,15
…放下今生的担子
...to be relieved of life's burden.

738
00:55:13,36 --> 00:55:17,39
我们就亲切的将他放入土中
Thus we commit their bodies to earth.

739
00:55:18,12 --> 00:55:20,39
他们本是尘土
From which they came,

740
00:55:20,80 --> 00:55:24,75
现在，他们依然是尘土
and do now return.

741
00:55:24,96 --> 00:55:28,95
我们知道，这一切的生命气息
We know we can place ourselves,

742
00:55:29,12 --> 00:55:33,55
都在永生的慈爱的天父手里
in the hands of our Father in Heaven,

743
00:55:33,76 --> 00:55:37,67
而且他应允将永生…
who has promised us eternal life.

744
00:55:39,32 --> 00:55:41,27
我们是张麻子张大爷的队伍！
We're from "Pocky" Zhang's gang.

745
00:55:41,88 --> 00:55:43,27
要钱！不要命！
We're here for the money.

746
00:55:43,68 --> 00:55:44,63
各位乡绅受惊了
Sorry for the intrusion!

747
00:55:44,80 --> 00:55:46,11
我们今天就是来找几个人
We're looking for...

748
00:55:46,28 --> 00:55:49,87
黄四郎！城南两大家族！站出来
Huang, heads of families, show yourselves!

749
00:55:57,40 --> 00:55:58,27
胡万？
Hu Wan?

750
00:55:59,92 --> 00:56:01,59
神父，打扰了
Father, our apologies.

751
00:56:02,04 --> 00:56:02,59
各位父老
Ladies and gentlemen,

752
00:56:02,76 --> 00:56:04,51
剩下的事情就与你们无关了
the rest has nothing to do with this.

753
00:56:04,68 --> 00:56:05,63
再见
Leave!

754
00:56:06,04 --> 00:56:06,95
入袋
Gag them!

755
00:56:08,64 --> 00:56:09,55
起来
Get up!

756
00:56:11,76 --> 00:56:13,27
好汉！我是本县县长
I'm the governor of this county.

757
00:56:13,44 --> 00:56:14,42
要绑，绑我吧
I volunteer to be your hostage.

758
00:56:14,64 --> 00:56:15,62
你不说话不行吗！
Just shut up!

759
00:56:15,80 --> 00:56:17,43
留着你的命，活着替我们收钱
We spare you to deliver our ransom.

760
00:56:17,64 --> 00:56:19,35
三天之内，钱到，放人
Three days, pay up and they go home.

761
00:56:19,60 --> 00:56:20,95
钱不到，撕票 打死我吧
- If not, they die. - Shoot me first!

762
00:56:21,12 --> 00:56:22,43
别打别打！ 打死我！
- Stop it! - Shoot me first!

763
00:56:22,64 --> 00:56:23,43
找打是吧
You're asking for it.

764
00:56:24,16 --> 00:56:26,03
打…！
Beat him up!

765
00:56:26,20 --> 00:56:27,83
你怎么这么多嘴啊！
You talk too much!

766
00:56:28,32 --> 00:56:30,23
让你多嘴
I'll teach you a lesson!

767
00:56:33,72 --> 00:56:35,83
你装模做样的带我的九筒干什么
Stop messing with my mask!

768
00:56:36,00 --> 00:56:36,75
别把事给我办砸了！
Don't screw things up.

769
00:56:37,32 --> 00:56:37,99
带走！
Take them away!

770
00:57:34,56 --> 00:57:38,15
三天收不到钱，麻匪可是要撕票的！
Otherwise they will kill the hostages.

771
00:57:38,32 --> 00:57:40,35
撕！让他们撕！
Let them kill the hostages.

772
00:57:40,56 --> 00:57:42,86
一定要让他们撕
In fact, I want them dead!

773
00:57:43,04 --> 00:57:45,87
替身就是为我干这个的
Why do you think I need a double?

774
00:57:46,04 --> 00:57:48,31
这个钱，我一分钱都不出！
I'll not pay any ransom.

775
00:57:48,52 --> 00:57:50,51
不过两大家族的钱
But the families will pay up.

776
00:57:50,68 --> 00:57:52,31
一定会过你们的手
You'll get your money for sure.

777
00:57:53,24 --> 00:57:54,35
弟弟
Brother,

778
00:57:55,04 --> 00:57:56,55
不要为我担心啊！
I'm fine.

779
00:57:56,72 --> 00:57:59,07
千万不要为我担心！
Don't worry about me.

780
00:58:00,80 --> 00:58:03,23
老爷，我怀疑胡万投靠了张麻子
Hu Wan must have defected to Zhang.

781
00:58:03,40 --> 00:58:04,35
一定要找到胡万！
He must be found,

782
00:58:04,56 --> 00:58:07,27
活要见人，死要见尸
dead or alive!

783
00:52:31,08 --> 00:52:32,59
骗豪绅，刮百姓
Creating more chances for Huang to swindle.

784
00:52:32,76 --> 00:52:33,35
然后呢？
And then?

785
00:52:33,56 --> 00:52:34,23
没了 没了？
- That's all. - Really?

786
00:52:34,40 --> 00:52:35,38
其他事我真不知道！
I don't know anything else!

787
00:52:55,88 --> 00:52:57,19
可大哥您脸上没麻子
Where are your pockmarks?

788
00:52:57,36 --> 00:52:58,91
黄四郎脸上有四吗？
Does your boss have "Huang" inscribed on his face?

789
00:53:00,56 --> 00:53:01,31
懂了
That's true.

790
00:53:01,52 --> 00:53:02,79
兄弟
My friend,

791
00:53:03,64 --> 00:53:05,07
我是张麻子这件事
you must not tell anyone,

792
00:53:05,24 --> 00:53:06,91
要替我永远保密
that I am "Pocky" Zhang.

793
00:53:07,08 --> 00:53:07,75
永远保密！
You have my word!

794
00:53:07,92 --> 00:53:11,03
我说我当不了县长
I never want to be a governor,

795
00:53:11,24 --> 00:53:15,83
你非花钱让我买这个官
but you still bought me this post!

796
00:53:17,56 --> 00:53:21,18
现在官被人家抢走了
The position has been usurped,

797
00:53:21,68 --> 00:53:25,79
你也就这么死了！
and now you're dead too.

798
00:53:26,88 --> 00:53:27,99
黄四郎带人来了
Huang has brought his militia.

799
00:53:28,16 --> 00:53:29,59
说是要帮我们打麻匪
Wanting to fight bandits with us.

800
00:58:15,60 --> 00:58:16,51
砸了
Yes, game's up.

801
00:58:16,68 --> 00:58:20,71
我怎么觉得…刚开始啊！
The fun has only just begun.

802
00:58:20,92 --> 00:58:22,63
阿门！
Amen!

803
00:58:33,24 --> 00:58:34,03
放人！
Release them.

804
00:58:34,20 --> 00:58:36,66
给你们留个纪念，不准回头，滚！
Here's a souvenir. Don't look back. Scram!

805
00:58:42,24 --> 00:58:44,95
夫人，你要是晚走两天
Ma'am, if you're still alive,

806
00:58:45,12 --> 00:58:47,11
就能亲眼看见了
you'd see this for yourself.

807
00:58:47,28 --> 00:58:49,99
嫂子要是不走，这钱都到不了这桌上
If she was alive, there'll be nothing here.

808
00:58:50,16 --> 00:58:53,03
对，我老婆的命换来的这些钱
She traded her life for this.

809
00:58:53,44 --> 00:58:54,91
那我们家小六子的命不算命啊？
Doesn't Six's life count?

810
00:58:55,08 --> 00:58:55,83
那不一样！
It's different.

811
00:58:56,00 --> 00:58:56,83
怎么就不一样啊？
Goddamned it isn't!

812
00:58:57,00 --> 00:58:57,67
夫人！
My wife.

813
00:58:57,84 --> 00:58:58,35
谁夫人啊？
Whose wife?

814
00:58:58,56 --> 00:58:59,19
我夫人！
Mine.

815
00:58:59,36 --> 00:58:59,87
你夫人怎么了？
What about her?

816
00:59:00,04 --> 00:59:01,95
夫人是被黄四郎杀死的
She was murdered by Huang.

817
00:59:02,12 --> 00:59:05,11
你们家六爷自残，自杀！
But Six died at his own hands.

818
00:59:06,00 --> 00:59:06,79
我一枪崩了你
I'll shoot you dead,

819
00:59:06,96 --> 00:59:08,91
你敢说我们家小六子，找死啊！
for demeaning our Six!

820
00:59:09,08 --> 00:59:10,43
老二你把枪放下
Two, put down your gun.

821
00:59:10,64 --> 00:59:11,62
别拿枪对着我
Stop pointing your gun at me!

822
00:59:11,80 --> 00:59:13,95
我见过土匪，没见过练肌肉的土匪
I've never seen bandits as dumb as you!

823
00:59:16,44 --> 00:59:18,87
笑什么啊，别笑，别笑！
Stop laughing! Cut it out.

824
00:59:19,04 --> 00:59:21,91
我是说你们家六爷，你们家六爷这样
I didn't belittle Six! He had courage!

825
00:59:22,08 --> 00:59:23,14
那是英雄
He was a hero!

826
00:59:23,36 --> 00:59:24,67
是，是英雄
Yes, he was heroic.

827
00:59:24,84 --> 00:59:31,02
我老婆睡着觉，就没醒过来
My wife went to sleep and died in bed.

828
00:59:32,00 --> 00:59:33,99
师爷不哭，嫂子也是英雄
Don't cry! Your wife was heroic, too.

829
00:59:34,36 --> 00:59:36,19
各位哥哥，咱们为什么来了？
Brothers, why are we here?

830
00:59:36,36 --> 00:59:37,19
钱啊
To get rich!

831
01:01:11,60 --> 01:01:14,75
老天爷都能当，还收拾不了一个黄四郎？
If I am God, ridding him should be a piece of cake.

832
00:56:39,20 --> 00:56:40,34
是他！ 老三！
- It's him. - Three!

833
00:56:40,56 --> 00:56:41,51
装箱
Pack them!

834
00:56:43,80 --> 00:56:44,99
不见钱不放人啊！
No one goes until we get his ransom.

835
00:56:45,80 --> 00:56:47,87
千哥，忍着！
Butler, stay calm!

836
00:56:50,40 --> 00:56:52,27
一二三！
One, two, three...

837
00:56:52,76 --> 00:56:54,11
黄四郎在里头
Huang is in there!

838
00:56:54,28 --> 00:56:55,95
一二三！
One, two, three...

839
00:56:56,84 --> 00:56:58,51
你抱着我夫人学我哭的时候
You plotted this scheme

840
00:56:58,68 --> 00:56:59,59
就想到这招了
over my wife's dead body?

841
00:59:37,36 --> 00:59:37,99
钱到了吗？
Have we succeeded?

842
00:59:38,16 --> 00:59:39,22
到了
Yes, we have.

843
00:59:40,00 --> 00:59:40,83
走啊！
So let's leave!

844
00:59:41,00 --> 00:59:41,59
走啊
Let's go.

845
00:59:41,76 --> 00:59:42,51
那你还哭什么呀？
Why are you still in tears?

846
00:59:42,68 --> 00:59:43,35
我可以不哭
I'm overjoyed.

847
00:59:43,56 --> 00:59:44,91
大哥，什么时候走？
Chief, when do we leave?

848
01:01:06,64 --> 01:01:08,07
你不就是想当老天爷吗？
Haven't you always wanted to play God?

849
01:01:08,24 --> 01:01:08,91
是啊
Yes.

850
01:01:09,08 --> 01:01:11,43
这跟收拾黄四郎有什么关系呀？
What has it got to do with Huang?

851
01:02:27,44 --> 01:02:29,51
还为了一个女人
and we're bickering over a broad!

852
01:02:43,36 --> 01:02:46,95
我进城那天，带头敲鼓的是你吧
You're the lead drummer at my inauguration?

853
01:02:48,40 --> 01:02:50,86
姑娘，贵姓？
What's your name?

854
01:02:51,08 --> 01:02:53,23
不客气，花姐
Call me Flora.

855
01:02:53,60 --> 01:02:55,59
不是姓黄吧？
Are you related to Huang?

856
01:02:55,88 --> 01:02:58,59
不姓！是黄四郎把我买来的
No, he bought me.

857
01:03:00,32 --> 01:03:03,03
城门口贴的那些告示
There are posters by the city gate.

858
01:03:03,36 --> 01:03:04,99
知道是什么意思吧？
Know what they're for?

859
01:03:05,60 --> 01:03:07,27
通缉张麻子的
Bounty offers for "Pocky" Zhang.

860
01:03:09,00 --> 01:03:11,38
我就是张麻子
I am "Pocky" Zhang.

861
01:03:12,96 --> 01:03:15,79
麻匪发的，铁证如山！
The bandits were behind this.

862
01:03:16,36 --> 01:03:20,55
用面具的就是麻匪？我们也有面具
Is it because of the masks? We have masks too!

863
01:03:20,80 --> 01:03:22,27
那就是县长？
Then it must be the Governor!

864
01:03:24,24 --> 01:03:26,95
有钱不赚，发给穷人
He is giving money to the poor?

865
01:03:30,04 --> 01:03:32,60
这像是个买官的县长做的事吗？
No bogus governor would do that.

866
01:03:35,12 --> 01:03:38,03
今天，我要你们扮成麻匪
I want you to dress up as bandits.

867
01:03:38,20 --> 01:03:39,83
跟他们一模一样
Exactly like them.

868
01:03:40,00 --> 01:03:42,83
他们怎么发，你们就怎么抢！
What they give out, you take away.

869
01:03:43,12 --> 01:03:44,18
搞乱他们！
Let's cause havoc!

870
01:03:44,64 --> 01:03:45,51
明白！
Understood.

871
01:03:45,68 --> 01:03:48,79
三步棋必治他于死地
I'll have him checkmate in 3 moves!

872
01:03:49,60 --> 01:03:52,43
老爷，三步棋，咱们都已经走完了
But we've made 3 moves already.

873
01:03:53,16 --> 01:03:53,63
是吗？
Really?

874
01:03:53,76 --> 01:03:55,67
逼死小六子，杀鸡取卵…
Driving Six to death, killing the chicken for the eggs...

875
00:58:07,60 --> 00:58:10,55
替身这么有用啊！得空帮我也找一个
A double is useful. Find me one, too.

876
00:58:10,72 --> 00:58:13,28
张麻子，你真是死不要脸
Pocky, have you no shame?

877
00:58:13,44 --> 00:58:14,71
玩砸了！
The game's up!

878
00:58:14,88 --> 00:58:15,39
砸了吗？
Really?

879
01:01:26,52 --> 01:01:27,95
这个，我认识
I think I know her.

880
00:54:50,20 --> 00:54:53,59
都来都来，我会安排
Certainly. I'll take care of it.

881
00:54:59,40 --> 00:55:04,26

"Here lies Madam Governor"

882
01:02:13,56 --> 01:02:16,83
见过麻匪真面目的，必死无疑！
Whoever sees a bandit's face has to die.

883
01:02:17,00 --> 01:02:18,51
这可是你下的令
It's your own rule.

884
01:02:18,68 --> 01:02:19,87
师爷
Counselor.

885
01:02:20,60 --> 01:02:22,75
第一个见过麻匪真面目的人
The first to see our faces

886
01:02:22,92 --> 01:02:24,23
是你！
was you!

887
01:02:24,80 --> 01:02:27,26
事还没办呢就起内证！
Our mission is only half accomplished,

888
01:03:57,40 --> 01:03:59,43
现在我要走的新三步
I'm talking about 3 new moves!

889
01:03:59,64 --> 01:04:02,55
第一步，到省城查清马邦德
First, check out the Governor.

890
01:04:02,72 --> 01:04:05,87
我总觉得他不像是个买官的县长
He doesn't act like someone who'd buy a post.

891
01:04:06,60 --> 01:04:08,87
起码，不姓马！
At least, he's not Ma Bangde.

892
01:04:10,24 --> 01:04:11,55
胡万的事怎么样了？
Have you found Hu Wan?

893
01:04:12,24 --> 01:04:14,43
胡万？还没找到
Hu Wan? Not yet.

894
01:04:15,28 --> 01:04:17,31
你怎么可能说还没有找到
How come he is still missing?

895
01:04:17,52 --> 01:04:19,63
老爷你放心，我会去找他，继续找
Don't worry, sir. I'll find him.

896
01:04:19,80 --> 01:04:21,07
你晓不晓得…
Do you know...

897
01:04:22,52 --> 01:04:24,51
我多么的想他
how much I miss him?

898
01:04:38,16 --> 01:04:40,75
黄老爷盼咐我们把他们搞乱
On master's order, let's wreak havoc!

899
01:04:41,16 --> 01:04:43,43
看老子怎么把他们搞乱
Let's show how we can mess things up!

900
01:04:45,88 --> 01:04:46,63
收到银子了？
Did you get your share?

901
01:04:46,80 --> 01:04:48,27
收到了
Yes.

902
01:04:49,00 --> 01:04:50,87
那你打算怎么感谢我们
How are you going to thank us?

903
01:04:51,72 --> 01:04:54,75
怎么感谢都…都行
Any way you like.

904
01:04:55,32 --> 01:04:58,63
怎么感谢都行？你说的！好！
Any way I like? Great, you said it!

905
01:05:00,32 --> 01:05:03,75
知道我们…为什么会给你发银子吗？
Know why we gave you money?

906
01:05:04,08 --> 01:05:06,64
因为麻匪爷对我们好
It is because you're benevolent.

907
01:05:06,80 --> 01:05:07,94
对你好？
Benevolent?

908
01:05:08,12 --> 01:05:09,75
还没好透！
We can do even better!

909
01:05:16,96 --> 01:05:20,58
透！透！透！
Batter! Batter!

910
01:05:28,12 --> 01:05:31,99
青天大老爷做主啊！
Governor, we want justice!

911
01:05:32,20 --> 01:05:34,19
砸了你们！砸了！
It's all over! We're finished!

912
01:05:34,84 --> 01:05:37,27
兔子都知道不吃窝边草
Even rabbits wouldn't do this.

913
01:05:37,64 --> 01:05:39,94
六个人，还当着人家丈夫
Six men, in front of her husband,

914
01:05:40,12 --> 01:05:41,23
还让人看
and in broad daylight!

915
01:05:41,40 --> 01:05:43,35
呸！恶心
Disgusting!

916
01:05:43,56 --> 01:05:45,03
我都关着灯！
I've never even done this with lights on!

917
01:05:46,16 --> 01:05:48,35
这种事你们可以花点钱嘛！
If you're desperate, paid for it!

918
01:05:48,76 --> 01:05:49,95
花点！
Be extravagant!

919
01:05:50,32 --> 01:05:51,91
哪怕缥呢！
Visit a brothel!

920
01:05:52,12 --> 01:05:53,75
花不了多少钱！
It won't cost much!

921
01:05:53,92 --> 01:05:55,39
哪怕偷偷摸摸的
You don't even have to be discreet.

922
01:05:56,00 --> 01:05:58,03
简直就是土匪
This is stupid!

923
01:05:58,20 --> 01:05:59,91
土匪都不如！
You're worse than bandits!

924
01:06:00,96 --> 01:06:03,11
还说让人家百姓夸你们好
And we'd wanted to leave a good impression!

925
00:59:47,64 --> 00:59:48,67
不走！
We're not.

926
00:59:49,04 --> 00:59:51,03
钱不是黄四郎送来的
This is not Huang's money.

927
00:59:51,20 --> 00:59:54,11
大哥，两大家族的钱不算钱啊？
But the money's still good!

928
00:59:54,28 --> 00:59:56,63
我要的是黄四郎的钱！
I want Huang's fortune.

929
00:59:58,00 --> 01:00:00,83
你不刮穷人的钱，也不要大户的钱…
You refuse to take money from rich or poor...

930
01:00:01,00 --> 01:00:04,70
六子，夫人，两条命
The blood debt of Six and Madam,

931
01:00:04,88 --> 01:00:07,03
必须黄四郎来偿！
must be repaid by Huang!

932
01:00:07,20 --> 01:00:09,55
你这是玩命啊！赌徒！
You're gambling with our lives!

933
01:00:09,72 --> 01:00:10,83
这就算赌了？
You call this a gamble?

934
01:00:11,00 --> 01:00:14,03
算！就是！还赌不赢
Yes, and you'll end up a loser!

935
01:00:17,56 --> 01:00:18,70
人不走
We're not leaving.

936
01:00:19,16 --> 01:00:20,27
钱也都不要了！
We don't want this money either.

937
01:00:20,44 --> 01:00:21,39
发出去！
Give them away.

938
01:00:21,60 --> 01:00:22,82
可是，大哥
But Chief...

939
01:00:24,20 --> 01:00:25,87
这钱你都发给谁呢？
Who do you want to give this to?

940
01:00:26,96 --> 01:00:28,35
发给穷人叹！
To the poor.

941
01:00:28,72 --> 01:00:30,27
那谁是穷人啊？
Who are the poor?

942
01:00:30,44 --> 01:00:33,35
谁穷，谁就是穷人
Those in dire need.

943
01:00:56,96 --> 01:00:58,59
劫我的时候，你戴的就是九筒
You wore "Nine" when you ambushed me.

944
01:00:58,76 --> 01:00:59,79
我这是多少？
What am I wearing now?

945
01:00:59,96 --> 01:01:01,18
你自己摸摸
Feel it for yourself.

946
01:01:02,60 --> 01:01:03,79
洲卜产卜 一同
"One"!

947
01:01:04,84 --> 01:01:05,35
过瘾吗？
Fun, isn't it?

948
01:01:05,56 --> 01:01:06,43
过瘾！
Brilliant!

949
01:09:33,32 --> 01:09:34,23
这就能骑？
I can ride that?

950
01:09:34,40 --> 01:09:36,23
我们在上海骑过！
We rode one once in Shanghai.

951
01:09:36,80 --> 01:09:37,99
你们俩去过上海？
You have been to Shanghai?

952
01:09:38,24 --> 01:09:39,11
浦东
Pudong!

953
01:09:39,36 --> 01:09:42,19
不信，骑上准倒！
I'm sure you'd fall over.

954
01:09:43,44 --> 01:09:45,51
来！试试！
Come on. Try it.

955
01:06:39,92 --> 01:06:41,95
大哥，你是了解我的
You know me,

956
01:06:42,28 --> 01:06:43,39
如果是我…
If it was me,

957
01:06:44,16 --> 01:06:46,03
不会有人活着来告状
she wouldn't have lived to squeal.

958
01:06:47,56 --> 01:06:48,70
大哥你是了解我的
You know me.

959
01:06:48,88 --> 01:06:50,55
我老五虽然岁数最大
I may be the eldest,

960
01:06:50,96 --> 01:06:52,87
我…我至今…
but I am...

961
01:06:54,84 --> 01:06:56,11
俗称处男
still a virgin.

962
01:07:00,56 --> 01:07:01,78
别看着我呀
Stop staring at me!

963
01:07:01,96 --> 01:07:03,95
大哥，你是了解我的
You know me well.

964
01:07:04,28 --> 01:07:05,63
如果我出手…
If I was responsible,

965
01:07:05,92 --> 01:07:07,35
那趴在桌子上的
the one on the receiving end,

966
01:07:08,04 --> 01:07:09,63
应该是她老公
would have been her husband!

967
01:07:15,20 --> 01:07:19,63
我听出来了，你们都个个身怀绝技
Each of you is so unique.

968
01:07:21,80 --> 01:07:22,94
但是…
But...

969
01:07:23,28 --> 01:07:24,07
有人骗了我
I've been betrayed.

970
01:07:24,24 --> 01:07:25,38
谁呀？谁呀？
By who?

971
01:07:26,72 --> 01:07:27,94
老汤
Tang!

972
01:07:28,12 --> 01:07:31,11
这么明显的事，一个师爷看不出来？
How could he overlook the obvious?

973
01:07:31,44 --> 01:07:34,51
这明明是黄四郎狗狼养的找人冒充的
Huang is behind this scam.

974
01:07:35,12 --> 01:07:36,99
他今天很反常
Tang's not behaving properly.

975
01:07:37,24 --> 01:07:38,95
心里一定有鬼
He must be up to something.

976
01:07:39,88 --> 01:07:42,23
出来！起来！站起来！
Come out! Stand up!

977
01:07:48,28 --> 01:07:51,79
你最近跟什么人吃过饭？
Who have you been seeing lately?

978
01:07:52,04 --> 01:07:53,02
见过黄四郎？
Master Huang?

979
01:07:53,32 --> 01:07:54,19
不许动！举起腿来！
Don't move! Raise your legs.

980
01:01:28,12 --> 01:01:29,26
我也认识
So do I!

981
01:01:29,52 --> 01:01:30,91
给她发点钱吧
Let's give her some money.

982
01:01:31,64 --> 01:01:33,11
干什么呀？
Hang on!

983
01:01:33,28 --> 01:01:35,95
大哥说了，发穷人！她不穷
She is not exactly poor, is she?

984
01:01:36,12 --> 01:01:38,31
那你说，谁算穷人？
So who are the poor?

985
01:01:38,52 --> 01:01:41,99
穷人？那就得被逼得卖儿卖女！
Those who're forced to sell their own children.

986
01:01:42,16 --> 01:01:45,27
她，就是被穷人卖掉的女儿！
Correct! She was sold by her parents.

987
01:01:45,52 --> 01:01:46,79
对呀！
Make sense!

988
01:02:00,28 --> 01:02:02,84
原来县长的人是麻匪！
So you're bandits in disguise!

989
01:02:03,00 --> 01:02:05,63
我们就想给你发点钱！
We've come to give you money.

990
01:02:06,64 --> 01:02:08,39
杀！必须的！
Kill her. No option!

991
01:07:57,92 --> 01:07:59,14
你是个孩子？
You're a child?

992
01:07:59,52 --> 01:08:00,63
几岁？ 八岁！
- How old are you? - Eight!

993
01:08:01,08 --> 01:08:02,14
出来！
Come out!

994
01:08:05,16 --> 01:08:06,30
这是八岁？!
He's eight?

995
01:08:06,60 --> 01:08:08,15
没人信！我都不信！
I find it hard to believe myself!

996
01:08:08,32 --> 01:08:09,71
三岁跟他妈一样高
As tall as Mom when he was three.

997
01:08:09,88 --> 01:08:12,51
五岁就跟我一样高，八岁就这样了
Taller than me when he was five...

998
01:08:12,80 --> 01:08:14,19
你妈！你妈！
Screw you!

999
01:08:16,36 --> 01:08:17,07
妈！妈！
Mom, mom!

1000
01:08:17,24 --> 01:08:18,35
你妈！
Screw you!

1001
01:08:18,80 --> 01:08:19,71
敢打俺娃！
Hands off my boy!

1002
01:08:19,92 --> 01:08:23,15
你妈！ 你妈！
- Screw you! - Screw you, too!

1003
01:08:23,32 --> 01:08:24,71
你妈！
Screw you!

1004
01:08:27,28 --> 01:08:27,95
这是你亲妈？
She's your mother?

1005
01:08:28,12 --> 01:08:28,91
是我妈
Yes, she is.

1006
01:08:29,04 --> 01:08:29,75
这是你亲爹？
And he's your dad?

1007
01:08:29,92 --> 01:08:32,27
我家的事关你屁事啊！你妈！
None of your goddamned business.

1008
01:08:32,96 --> 01:08:33,99
你妈！
Stop it!

1009
01:08:34,56 --> 01:08:35,83
嫂子！怎么回事？
Ma'am, what's going on?

1010
01:08:36,00 --> 01:08:38,03
我是来要钱的，不给钱我不走
I come for money. I won't leave until he pays.

1011
01:08:38,20 --> 01:08:39,18
不给钱不走
He owes you?

1012
01:08:39,36 --> 01:08:43,27
这个老骗子，八年前在俺山西开矿
It was eight years ago in Shanxi.

1013
01:08:43,44 --> 01:08:46,31
骗了钱我就不说了，还骗了我的身子
This crook made me pregnant.

1014
01:08:46,52 --> 01:08:47,71
还不讲信誉
He is a man of poor repute.

1015
01:08:48,12 --> 01:08:49,15
他欠一屁股帐
Ran up a mountain of debts,

1016
01:08:49,32 --> 01:08:50,35
拍屁股走了
then vanished without trace.

1017
01:08:50,56 --> 01:08:53,31
人家问俺追帐，把我六岁的娃给绑了
Creditors kidnapped my younger son.

1018
01:08:53,52 --> 01:08:55,79
当人质呢，不给钱就撕票了！
He'll die if I don't clear his debts.

1019
01:08:55,96 --> 01:08:56,59
那不是我的
He's not my child!

1020
01:08:56,76 --> 01:08:57,74
那就是你的
He is!

1021
01:08:57,96 --> 01:08:59,10
不是我的 就是你的！
- He isn't. - He is!

1022
01:08:59,28 --> 01:09:01,23
是你的，我算着日子呢！
He is! I counted the days!

1023
01:09:48,60 --> 01:09:49,66
上来
Hop on!

1024
01:09:52,80 --> 01:09:54,11
走，走了！
Let's go!

1025
01:10:02,64 --> 01:10:03,95
自行车！
Bicycle!

1026
01:10:06,08 --> 01:10:07,43
自行车！
Bicycle!

1027
01:10:09,52 --> 01:10:12,43
可是，人肉的自行车
made of flesh and bones...

1028
01:10:14,44 --> 01:10:15,95
我来错地方了？
Have I come to the wrong place?

1029
01:10:16,44 --> 01:10:18,27
我来的不是时候？
Or at the wrong time?

1030
01:10:18,68 --> 01:10:19,35
接客
Serve your customers.

1031
01:10:19,56 --> 01:10:20,27
他们俩都是
They're my customers.

1032
01:03:55,84 --> 01:03:57,23
那是老三步了
Those were old moves!

1033
01:06:03,28 --> 01:06:05,35
就是一句话！恶心！
One word comes to mind: revolting!

1034
01:06:05,56 --> 01:06:07,31
钱肯定是赚不着了！
Our scheme is now in ruin!

1035
01:06:07,56 --> 01:06:09,51
恶心！恶心！
Disgusting!

1036
01:06:09,88 --> 01:06:11,99
恶心呐！恶心！
Filthy, nauseating...

1037
01:06:12,36 --> 01:06:14,79
呸！太恶心！
Revolting!

1038
01:06:24,84 --> 01:06:26,55
大哥，你是了解我的
You know me.

1039
01:06:26,92 --> 01:06:29,15
我从来不做仗势欺人的事
When it comes to this sort of thing,

1040
01:06:29,88 --> 01:06:31,39
我喜欢被动
I prefer to be passive...

1041
01:06:32,60 --> 01:06:34,11
大哥你是了解我的
You know me,

1042
01:06:34,60 --> 01:06:35,87
以我的习’惯
I am a lone wolf,

1043
01:06:36,88 --> 01:06:38,43
万事不求人
always acting on my own.

1044
01:14:40,72 --> 01:14:41,75
他戴的是几筒？
Which mask does he wear?

1045
01:10:36,88 --> 01:10:38,83
那不是麻匪扔进来的吗？
Isn't that bandit money?

1046
01:10:40,40 --> 01:10:42,70
难道他们俩是麻匪？
I wonder if they are also bandits.

1047
01:10:42,88 --> 01:10:45,79
他们不是麻匪，他们是官府的人
No, they work for the Governor.

1048
01:10:47,04 --> 01:10:49,50
你敢拿麻匪的钱给他们付帐？
How dare you pay their tab with bandit money?

1049
01:10:49,68 --> 01:10:51,55
别废话！先把人放了，快点！
Cut the crap! Let her go!

1050
01:10:54,04 --> 01:10:55,83
英雄救美！
White knights to the rescue!

1051
01:10:57,56 --> 01:10:59,35
英雄救美！
White knights to the rescue!

1052
01:11:01,92 --> 01:11:05,43
就算他们是英雄，我也不是美人
I'm no damsel in distress.

1053
01:11:06,20 --> 01:11:09,87
就算我是美人，他们也不是英雄
They're no knights in shining armour.

1054
01:11:32,00 --> 01:11:34,03
老爷，毕竟他们是客人
After all, they're customers.

1055
01:11:34,20 --> 01:11:37,23
今天晚上的钱，我替他们付了
I've already settled their bills.

1056
01:11:37,60 --> 01:11:39,11
您不是常教育我们吗
You taught me yourself,

1057
01:11:39,28 --> 01:11:41,07
客人永远是上帝
customers are always supreme!

1058
01:11:41,36 --> 01:11:42,91
您说对吗？
Isn't that right?

1059
01:11:46,80 --> 01:11:47,83
对！
Yes!

1060
01:11:48,52 --> 01:11:49,58
对！
Correct!

1061
01:12:05,76 --> 01:12:08,95
这就不是英雄救美了
Instead of knights coming to your rescue,

1062
01:12:09,52 --> 01:12:11,71
是美救英雄
they are being saved by a damsel.

1063
01:12:13,04 --> 01:12:17,15
你呀，快成小凤仙儿了
You're turning into a Mata Hari.

1064
01:12:29,68 --> 01:12:30,79
你得罪他了！
You've just pissed him off.

1065
01:12:31,04 --> 01:12:32,31
黄四郎不用得罪
He doesn't need to be pissed off.

1066
01:12:32,52 --> 01:12:33,95
他想让谁死
If he wants you dead,

1067
01:12:34,12 --> 01:12:35,55
谁就得死！
you die!

1068
01:12:35,72 --> 01:12:37,55
我刚才干嘛不一枪打死他呢？
I should've put a bullet through his head.

1069
01:12:37,72 --> 01:12:39,43
我一枪打死他不就完了么！
That would be the end of it.

1070
01:12:40,12 --> 01:12:41,07
别傻了！
Don't be silly.

1071
01:12:41,24 --> 01:12:44,27
大哥说了，留着他是要弄他的钱
Chief wants to go after his fortune.

1072
01:12:45,32 --> 01:12:48,27
既然想弄钱，那…
If you're here for the money, then...

1073
01:12:48,60 --> 01:12:50,55
你们干嘛到处发钱啊？
why are you giving it away?

1074
01:12:52,24 --> 01:12:52,79
这颜色行么
Is this the right colour?

1075
01:12:52,96 --> 01:12:54,27
把伞拿了
Lower the umbrella.

1076
01:12:54,84 --> 01:12:57,27
红倒是够了，你…你过来
The red is fine. Come over here!

1077
01:12:58,44 --> 01:13:00,35
先是绿，再弄红
First apply green, then red.

1078
01:13:00,56 --> 01:13:01,43
明白
Okay, got it.

1079
01:13:01,64 --> 01:13:02,91
明白这意思吧？
Understand?

1080
01:13:04,28 --> 01:13:05,50
你把那锁好了啊
Don't forget to lock up.

1081
01:13:05,68 --> 01:13:06,99
带上铁锹 知道了
- Bring the shovels. - Got it.

1082
01:13:07,20 --> 01:13:09,39
六把铁锹 知道了
- Six shovels! - Got it.

1083
01:13:13,08 --> 01:13:13,75
大哥你看我…
Chief, how do I look?

1084
01:13:13,92 --> 01:13:16,83
头不用梳了，脸够红，你过来！
Hair is fine. Face is flushed. Come here...

1085
01:07:54,36 --> 01:07:55,87
谁？！ 孩子！孩子
- Who's there? - A boy, my child!

1086
01:07:56,00 --> 01:07:57,11
孩子？ 我的！
- Your child? - Yes, mine.

1087
01:09:06,24 --> 01:09:07,83
把你的小儿子绑架了
and kidnapped your younger son.

1088
01:09:08,72 --> 01:09:09,43
不给钱就撕票
Threatening death...

1089
01:09:09,64 --> 01:09:11,43
撕票，所以我要钱呢！
Yes, so I need the money.

1090
01:09:11,64 --> 01:09:12,67
给钱！
Pay her.

1091
01:09:13,16 --> 01:09:14,38
钱，石头！
Money! The stones...

1092
01:09:16,04 --> 01:09:17,75
嫂子，初次见面
Just a small gift,

1093
01:09:18,24 --> 01:09:19,55
不成敬意
to mark our acquaintance.

1094
01:09:20,12 --> 01:09:22,58
石头我不要，不给钱我不走
I don't want these. I want real money.

1095
01:09:22,76 --> 01:09:24,15
你个傻…
You stupid idiot...

1096
01:09:24,68 --> 01:09:27,14
这比钱值钱！这是宝石
These diamonds are worth a fortune!

1097
01:09:27,32 --> 01:09:29,23
啊！真的！
No kidding?

1098
01:09:32,08 --> 01:09:33,14
自行车
Bicycle!

1099
01:17:35,96 --> 01:17:37,18
听不见
I can't hear you.

1100
01:17:41,00 --> 01:17:42,06
听不见！
I can't hear you!

1101
01:17:42,24 --> 01:17:43,30
城里麻匪火拼
There was a shoot-out.

1102
01:17:43,52 --> 01:17:46,67
死了六个人！咱们的人安然无恙！
Six killed. We're unscathed.

1103
01:17:55,96 --> 01:17:58,23
师爷，来来，请
Counselor, come take a look.

1104
01:18:01,12 --> 01:18:03,55
或许…是你的恩人呐
Your saviour may be among them.

1105
01:13:17,20 --> 01:13:19,43
死人的脸是绿的，加上点别的色
Apply that to a dead man's face

1106
01:13:19,64 --> 01:13:20,86
然后再变成这种红
will turn it into pinkish red.

1107
01:13:21,04 --> 01:13:22,59
明白了 明白了吧
- Got it. - Good.

1108
01:13:22,76 --> 01:13:23,67
绿
Green.

1109
01:13:24,80 --> 01:13:25,99
你过来
Come here.

1110
01:13:26,60 --> 01:13:27,79
绿在底下
Green is the base colour.

1111
01:13:28,04 --> 01:13:30,11
加上那个再变成这个就对了！
Add that and you'll get this!

1112
01:13:30,68 --> 01:13:32,87
明白了 明白吗
- Oh, I see... - Got it?

1113
01:13:33,04 --> 01:13:33,95
是这样的铁锹吗？
You want shovels like these?

1114
01:13:34,12 --> 01:13:35,18
锯短，装包里
Shorten them and put them in the bag.

1115
01:13:35,36 --> 01:13:35,91
多短？
How short?

1116
01:13:36,08 --> 01:13:37,19
能装包里
Short enough for the bag.

1117
01:13:37,32 --> 01:13:38,83
快去啊，六把啊
Hurry up! Six shovels!

1118
01:13:39,00 --> 01:13:40,11
去哪啊这是？
Where are you going?

1119
01:13:40,28 --> 01:13:41,67
怎么还扮上了？
What's with the make-up?

1120
01:13:41,84 --> 01:13:43,19
不是要跑吧？
Are you leaving for good?

1121
01:13:45,04 --> 01:13:47,55
你去不去？我们去发钱
Come with us to give out money?

1122
01:14:41,92 --> 01:14:42,51
九筒！
"Nine".

1123
01:14:42,68 --> 01:14:46,59
好极了！今晚不抢钱，杀人！
Splendid. Tonight we shall only kill!

1124
01:14:46,76 --> 01:14:47,39
杀谁？
Our target?

1125
01:14:47,60 --> 01:14:48,71
戴九筒的县长！
The Governor, wearing "Nine"!

1126
01:14:48,88 --> 01:14:52,50
杀县长不用戴面具，您等着验尸吧
Masked or not, consider this done!

1127
01:14:52,68 --> 01:14:54,75
回来！全给我戴上！
All of you, put on your masks!

1128
01:14:56,08 --> 01:14:57,43
麻匪火拼
"Firefight with bandits,

1129
01:14:58,16 --> 01:15:00,23
县长暴死
intrepid Governor killed!"

1130
01:15:01,20 --> 01:15:04,90
听着多么川页耳！
That would be music to my ears!

1131
00:21:42,24 --> 00:21:43,91
唱机都撂坏了
This gramophone was broken,

1132
00:21:44,40 --> 00:21:45,75
修好了
Now it is fixed.

1133
00:21:45,92 --> 00:21:48,22
这单活干完了，爹赚了钱
Once we're done here,

1134
00:21:48,40 --> 00:21:49,95
我送你去留洋
I'll let you study abroad.

1135
00:21:50,76 --> 00:21:51,82
东洋三年
3 years in the east,

1136
00:21:52,00 --> 00:21:53,55
西洋三年
3 in the west,

1137
00:21:53,84 --> 00:21:54,59
南洋三年
and 3 more in the south.

1138
00:21:54,76 --> 00:21:56,27
北洋，北洋三年
How about 3 years in the north?

1139
00:21:56,44 --> 00:21:59,83
傻孩子，你生在北洋，不必留了
No, you're born in the north.

1140
00:22:00,92 --> 00:22:02,39
这是谁吹的？
Who is this by?

1141
00:22:05,00 --> 00:22:08,59
听着像穆扎
I think it's Wolfgang.

1142
00:22:09,12 --> 00:22:10,31
他们那边叫穆扎
Sometime known as Amadeus.

1143
00:22:10,52 --> 00:22:12,27
咱们这边叫莫札特
We call him M-o-z-a-r-t.

1144
00:22:12,44 --> 00:22:15,00
你还能听出来是谁吹的呢？!
You can tell by listening?

1145
00:22:15,64 --> 00:22:16,43
得分时候
It depends.

1146
00:22:16,64 --> 00:22:18,11
什么时候？
On what?

1147
00:23:12,20 --> 00:23:13,23
是我自己要去的
It's my own plot.

1148
00:23:13,40 --> 00:23:15,70
没有人让我去，是我自己
There are no co-conspirators.

1149
00:23:16,92 --> 00:23:18,83
恩人！恩人！
Saviour! My saviour!

1150
00:23:21,00 --> 00:23:22,11
恩人！
Saviour!

1151
00:23:24,76 --> 00:23:26,51
你是叫我呢？
You're addressing me?

1152
00:23:27,44 --> 00:23:29,51
我什么时候成你恩人了？
Since when have I become your saviour?

1153
00:23:30,04 --> 00:23:32,19
不杀之恩为大恩！
You spared my life,

1154
00:23:32,44 --> 00:23:36,19
为报不杀之恩，我也救你一命
and I'll save yours in return.

1155
00:23:36,40 --> 00:23:38,51
哦？你快说
Do tell.

1156
00:23:39,84 --> 00:23:42,59
寡妇，不能睡啊！
Never sleep with a widow.

1157
00:23:44,28 --> 00:23:45,99
必有大灾！
It's very bad luck!

1158
00:23:50,64 --> 00:23:52,15
她…
She?

1159
00:23:52,76 --> 00:23:54,71
真的是寡妇么？
Is she really a widow?

1160
00:23:55,56 --> 00:23:57,07
我看着不像
She doesn't act like one.

1161
00:23:57,40 --> 00:24:00,03
我亲眼看见他丈夫淹死的
But I witnessed her husband drowned!

1162
00:24:07,16 --> 00:24:09,23
她已经成了寡妇
If she really is a widow,

1163
00:33:32,72 --> 00:33:34,31
就是恶霸请土匪！
It's just a meeting between two thugs!

1164
00:33:34,52 --> 00:33:36,11
项羽请刘邦啊！
It's like MacBeth hosting Banquo.

1165
00:33:36,28 --> 00:33:37,55
刘邦后来干什么去了？
What'd become of Banquo the guest?

1166
00:33:37,72 --> 00:33:38,31
当皇帝了
His son became king.

1167
00:33:38,52 --> 00:33:39,66
项羽呢？
And MacBeth the host?

1168
00:33:40,64 --> 00:33:43,23
那，赴宴？
So we should go.

1169
00:33:45,28 --> 00:33:48,27
赴宴！正好借机把黄四郎也笼络过来
We can also sound out Huang,

1170
00:33:48,44 --> 00:33:50,51
咱们三个联手一起捞钱
and see if we can work together.

1171
00:33:50,84 --> 00:33:52,43
“把家伙拿来”
"Bring the guns."

1172
00:33:55,60 --> 00:33:56,95
“换上黄家衣服跟我走”
"Dress up as Huang's militia and follow me."

1173
00:33:57,12 --> 00:33:57,95
明白
Got it!

1174
00:33:58,12 --> 00:33:59,55
“干掉黄四郎，给六子报仇”
"Kill Huang and avenge Six!"

1175
00:33:59,72 --> 00:34:01,07
明白
Understood!

1176
00:34:01,80 --> 00:34:06,07
老汤，你是把六子的死当捞钱的成本了？
You see Six's death as a shortcut to bonanza?

1177
00:34:06,52 --> 00:34:09,43
我看你当成本，赚的钱会更多
Perhaps your severed head can make us more.

1178
00:34:09,76 --> 00:34:10,79
这是什么意思？
What do you mean?

1179
00:34:11,72 --> 00:34:13,99
走！去会会你的新朋友
Let's go and meet your new pal.

1180
00:34:14,16 --> 00:34:15,55
立正！
Attention!

1181
00:34:38,72 --> 00:34:43,66
县长，师爷，大驾光临！有失远迎！
Governor, counselor! Welcome!

1182
00:34:43,88 --> 00:34:46,95
黄老爷的宅邸，竹林掩映，碉楼耸立
Master's citadel dominates Goose Town.

1183
01:15:13,80 --> 01:15:16,43
看清楚了，他们领头的戴几筒？
Which mask is their leader wearing?

1184
01:15:16,64 --> 01:15:17,70
九筒！
"Nine".

1185
01:15:17,96 --> 01:15:19,63
全都换上四筒！
Let's all change to "four"!

1186
01:15:20,96 --> 01:15:23,63
四筒是自己人，其他人全打死
Kill anyone who is not a "four"!

1187
01:15:23,84 --> 01:15:25,79
那边领头的戴的是几筒，看见了吗？
Which mask is their leader wearing?

1188
01:15:25,96 --> 01:15:27,10
四筒
"Four".

1189
01:15:27,32 --> 01:15:28,91
那咱们应该戴几筒，你知道吗？
Know what we'll be wearing, then?

1190
01:15:29,08 --> 01:15:29,99
明白
Got it.

1191
01:09:03,36 --> 01:09:04,75
他骗了人家钱
He swindled someone.

1192
01:09:05,08 --> 01:09:06,06
人家到你那去要帐
His victims tracked you down,

1193
01:10:20,44 --> 01:10:22,63
我们可是先来的
We're here first.

1194
01:10:22,80 --> 01:10:23,67
付钱了吗？
Have they paid?

1195
01:10:23,84 --> 01:10:25,83
自行车能算钱吗？
The "bicycle ride" doesn't count.

1196
01:10:27,12 --> 01:10:27,87
送客！
Show them out.

1197
01:10:28,04 --> 01:10:29,83
上次我给过你很多钱
But I've paid my dues.

1198
01:10:31,52 --> 01:10:32,66
什么钱？
With what?

1199
01:10:33,68 --> 01:10:36,19
窗户外边扔进来的银子？
Money you received through the window?

1200
01:14:24,24 --> 01:14:27,11
要慢，沉住气
you have to stay calm,

1201
01:14:27,32 --> 01:14:29,35
越慢越好
make it nice and slow.

1202
01:14:29,96 --> 01:14:30,99
你亲眼看见的？
You saw it with your own eyes?

1203
01:14:31,16 --> 01:14:32,07
我亲眼看见的！
Indeed.

1204
01:14:32,28 --> 01:14:36,06
你亲眼看见县长亲自带队出发？
You saw the Governor leading his men out?

1205
01:14:36,28 --> 01:14:36,95
我亲眼看见了！
Yes, with my own eyes.

1206
01:14:37,12 --> 01:14:39,31
你亲眼看见县长亲自带队出发去发钱？
They've gone to give out money?

1207
01:15:52,84 --> 01:15:55,07
黄老爷，你怎么在这啊？
Master Huang, what brings you here?

1208
01:15:55,84 --> 01:15:57,79
县衙我不能来吗？
Can I not visit the magistracy?

1209
01:15:59,24 --> 01:16:00,55
点上
Light it!

1210
01:16:00,96 --> 01:16:04,95
你们玩空城计，我就趁虚而入！
When the cat prowls, the mouse seizes control!

1211
01:16:07,08 --> 01:16:08,35
坐
Sit down!

1212
01:16:11,88 --> 01:16:13,35
县长呢？
Where's the Governor?

1213
01:16:18,52 --> 01:16:20,55
都是四筒，下不了手啊！
Everyone is a "Four"? I'm confused!

1214
01:16:20,72 --> 01:16:21,67
下不了手
I'm confused, too!

1215
01:16:21,84 --> 01:16:23,95
打雷天站在雨里头有点不讲究
It's bad to stay out in a thunderstorm.

1216
01:16:24,12 --> 01:16:24,99
太不讲究！
Yes, it's awful.

1217
01:16:25,16 --> 01:16:27,03
那改天再约，撤吧
Let's reschedule. Split!

1218
01:16:27,20 --> 01:16:28,15
撤！
Be in touch!

1219
01:16:28,32 --> 01:16:29,23
怎么撤？
What now?

1220
01:16:29,40 --> 01:16:30,71
从哪儿来，回哪儿去叹
It's back to square one.

1221
01:16:30,88 --> 01:16:32,63
好，从哪儿来，回哪儿去
Yes, square one.

1222
01:16:32,96 --> 01:16:35,26
一二三，撤！
Split! 1, 2, 3.

1223
01:16:46,56 --> 01:16:49,63
听，枪一响，就有人死
Listen! Someone's been shot.

1224
01:16:49,88 --> 01:16:52,63
有人死，就有人哭
Soon someone will mourn.

1225
01:16:53,16 --> 01:16:56,94
人一哭，就要说心里话
Mourning will lead to confessions.

1226
01:16:58,88 --> 01:17:00,15
说吧
Confess!

1227
01:13:47,72 --> 01:13:48,91
糟践东西，不去！
No, what a waste!

1228
01:13:49,08 --> 01:13:50,03
不去是吧 不去
- So you're not coming? - No.

1229
01:13:54,84 --> 01:13:55,63
那我告诉你
Now listen.

1230
01:13:55,80 --> 01:13:57,55
我这次去，可能回得来
This time, I may come back,

1231
01:13:57,72 --> 01:13:58,91
也可能回不来
but, then again, I may not.

1232
01:13:59,08 --> 01:14:01,03
我要是回来，你就跟我跑
If I do, you can leave with us.

1233
01:14:01,24 --> 01:14:03,87
我要是回不来，你就自己跑
If not, you plan your own getaway.

1234
01:14:39,52 --> 01:14:40,55
我亲眼看见了！
Yes, indeed.

1235
01:22:43,80 --> 01:22:45,31
我把人就埋在了那！
The bodies were buried there all along.

1236
01:22:46,84 --> 01:22:49,59
人埋在哪儿，事儿就出在哪儿！
I ensure the standoff was at their burial site.

1237
01:22:50,08 --> 01:22:53,51
事儿出在哪儿，黄四郎就得跟到哪儿！
That's where I led Huang to.

1238
01:22:55,92 --> 01:22:57,99
那你真是张麻子
I'm convinced you're "Pocky" Zhang.

1239
01:22:59,80 --> 01:23:00,91
坐！
Sit down.

1240
01:23:05,68 --> 01:23:06,99
我姓张
My name is Zhang.

1241
01:23:07,20 --> 01:23:08,03
知道
I know that.

1242
01:23:08,20 --> 01:23:09,39
叫牧之
Zhang Muzhi.

1243
01:15:30,16 --> 01:15:32,19
先弄死九筒！走！
Let's get rid of "Nine"!

1244
01:19:14,36 --> 01:19:18,14
你们看到了没有！这是当麻匪的下场！
Take a good look at a bandit's fate!

1245
01:19:18,32 --> 01:19:20,70
就算是我亲爹也得死！
I'd still have him shot

1246
01:19:21,20 --> 01:19:22,51
死有余辜！
if he was my father...

1247
01:19:23,84 --> 01:19:25,03
早晚！
sooner or later!

1248
01:19:29,16 --> 01:19:32,99
麻匪胡万又让黄老爷枪毙了五回
You just shot Hu Wan 5 more times.

1249
01:19:33,16 --> 01:19:34,19
大义灭亲？
You want to show justice?

1250
01:19:34,36 --> 01:19:35,91
杀人灭口？
Or to make sure he's dead?

1251
01:19:36,08 --> 01:19:40,79
杀人灭口，你就是麻匪的头子张麻子
Only "Pocky" Zhang would want to silence him.

1252
01:19:41,80 --> 01:19:44,59
要是大义灭亲，那好办！
If you'd only wanted to show justice,

1253
01:20:47,60 --> 01:20:48,95
接上他的腿
to fund an expedition to fix his broken leg!

1254
01:20:50,84 --> 01:20:52,43
大哥这个是惊喜啊
What a nice surprise!

1255
01:20:52,80 --> 01:20:54,43
小弟我愿意等你三天
I'm willing to wait 3 days.

1256
01:20:58,00 --> 01:20:58,95
黄老爷
Master Huang.

1257
01:20:59,24 --> 01:21:01,80
汤师爷是我的至爱
I adore my Counselor,

1258
01:21:02,28 --> 01:21:05,11
你可不能夺我所爱啊
I can't let you have him.

1259
01:21:06,12 --> 01:21:08,31
了然，了然
Fair enough.

1260
01:21:16,12 --> 01:21:17,23
六子
Six.

1261
01:21:17,84 --> 01:21:20,95
事已经办了九成了
We're almost there.

1262
01:21:22,04 --> 01:21:23,39
算七成吧
Say, 70% done.

1263
01:21:23,76 --> 01:21:25,59
今天我就派你二哥出城
I've asked Two to take off first.

1264
01:21:25,96 --> 01:21:27,79
到青石岭去接应我们
He'll wait for us at Emerald Creek.

1265
01:21:28,20 --> 01:21:31,59
乘l下的事，我会说到做到
I will keep my promise.

1266
01:21:35,56 --> 01:21:36,83
你明白了吧？
Know what you have to do?

1267
01:21:37,32 --> 01:21:38,67
明白
Yes.

1268
01:21:42,16 --> 01:21:43,83
一百八十万两银子到手
When $1.8 million is in hand,

1269
01:21:44,00 --> 01:21:47,23
我觉着小六子的仇算是报了
I'll consider Six avenged.

1270
01:21:48,92 --> 01:21:50,11
我觉着啊！
I feel that...

1271
01:21:51,76 --> 01:21:54,79
不光六子，夫人的仇也算报了
my wife's death is also avenged.

1272
01:21:59,00 --> 01:22:02,15
你不会真跟黄四郎玩命吧，恩人呐
Saviour, you still want to kill Huang?

1273
01:22:02,32 --> 01:22:04,51
我不是你恩人，黄四郎才是你恩人
I'm not your saviour. Huang is.

1274
01:22:06,80 --> 01:22:09,31
你是恩人，他不是！
You're my saviour. Not him.

1275
01:22:09,84 --> 01:22:11,87
你当时真的以为我死了？
Did you think I was lying dead back there?

1276
01:22:12,04 --> 01:22:13,99
没有！绝对没有
No, of course not.

1277
01:22:14,16 --> 01:22:14,67
没有？
Sure?

1278
01:22:14,84 --> 01:22:16,39
从没这么想过！
Never crossed my mind.

1279
01:22:21,52 --> 01:22:22,99
我可真算服了你了
I've to hand this to you.

1280
01:14:04,04 --> 01:14:05,91
去…去哪啊？不是发钱吗？
Aren't you just giving out money?

1281
01:14:06,08 --> 01:14:06,99
是发钱
Yes, we are.

1282
01:14:07,16 --> 01:14:08,35
还有…
By the way,

1283
01:14:11,84 --> 01:14:13,11
半夜的时候
at midnight tonight,

1284
01:14:13,76 --> 01:14:15,63
可能有人来找你
someone may come calling.

1285
01:14:15,80 --> 01:14:17,35
他要找你聊什么
Engage him in conversation.

1286
01:14:17,60 --> 01:14:19,15
你就跟他聊什么
Whatever the topics,

1287
01:14:19,60 --> 01:14:22,27
他怎么聊，你就怎么聊
just chat along with him.

1288
01:14:22,72 --> 01:14:24,03
但是…
But...

1289
01:17:01,00 --> 01:17:04,03
你至少有三句要说
You've at least three confessions to make.

1290
01:17:04,96 --> 01:17:06,99
我不该拿你的钻石送人
I shouldn't have given your diamonds away.

1291
01:17:14,56 --> 01:17:16,11
不是这句
Try again.

1292
01:17:17,04 --> 01:17:18,91
杀人诛心是我说的
I suggested "to kill someone, first destroy his soul".

1293
01:17:19,32 --> 01:17:21,43
也不是这句
Not that either.

1294
01:17:26,20 --> 01:17:28,71
鸿门宴要是我们请就好了
We should have hosted the banquet instead.

1295
01:17:29,44 --> 01:17:30,99
鸿门宴？
The banquet?

1296
01:19:56,96 --> 01:19:59,03
现在又成了你的恩人
Now he's your boss, too.

1297
01:19:59,60 --> 01:20:00,71
你给翻译翻译
Please act as our interpreter.

1298
01:20:01,44 --> 01:20:02,87
什么叫惊喜？
What is a "nice surprise"?

1299
01:20:03,40 --> 01:20:05,75
翻译翻译，什么叫惊喜？
Interpret for me.

1300
01:20:05,92 --> 01:20:06,98
这还用翻译？都说了…
There's nothing to interpret

1301
01:20:07,16 --> 01:20:10,51
我让你翻译给我听，什么叫惊喜
What on earth is a "nice surprise"?

1302
01:20:10,68 --> 01:20:11,87
不用翻译，就是惊京喜啊
It is what it is.

1303
01:20:12,04 --> 01:20:13,26
难道你听不懂什么叫惊喜
You just don't get it, do you?

1304
01:20:13,44 --> 01:20:16,15
我就想让你翻译翻译，什么叫惊喜！
Go ahead and interpret. What is it?

1305
01:20:16,32 --> 01:20:16,91
1京喜嘛…
A nice surprise!

1306
01:20:17,08 --> 01:20:18,06
翻译出来给我听
Translate for me!

1307
01:20:18,24 --> 01:20:20,95
什么他妈的叫惊喜！
What is this "nice surprise"?

1308
01:20:21,12 --> 01:20:25,07
什么他妈的叫他妈的惊喜！
What is this goddamned "nice surprise"?

1309
01:20:25,24 --> 01:20:27,15
什么他妈的叫惊喜啊？
What is this "nice surprise"?

1310
01:20:27,32 --> 01:20:28,71
惊喜就是三天之后
It means that in 3 days,

1311
01:20:28,88 --> 01:20:31,79
我出一百八十万，给你们出城剿匪
I'll put up $1.8 million for your campaign,

1312
01:20:31,96 --> 01:20:33,18
接上我的腿！
to fix my crippled leg!

1313
01:20:33,36 --> 01:20:34,55
明白了吗？
Is that clear?

1314
01:20:34,72 --> 01:20:36,15
这就是惊喜呀
That's the "nice surprise"!

1315
01:20:36,32 --> 01:20:38,19
翻译翻译
Interpret.

1316
01:20:41,52 --> 01:20:42,03
翻译翻译！
Interpret.

1317
01:20:42,20 --> 01:20:44,07
惊喜就是三天之后
The nice surprise is that,

1318
01:20:44,24 --> 01:20:47,39
给你一百八十万两银子，出城剿匪
he will give you $1.8 million in 3 days,

1319
01:18:03,72 --> 01:18:05,83
您才是我的恩人
No, you are my saviour.

1320
01:18:08,40 --> 01:18:09,83
既然我是你的恩人
If that is the case,

1321
01:18:10,00 --> 01:18:11,63
那就听恩人的话，揭开看看
remove his mask,

1322
01:18:11,80 --> 01:18:12,63
去吧，看看！
and have a good look.

1323
01:18:12,80 --> 01:18:14,91
来！照上照上！
Come on, lights!

1324
01:18:21,00 --> 01:18:22,35
什么情况？
What's going on?

1325
01:18:22,56 --> 01:18:24,55
什么情况？什么情况？
What's happening here?

1326
01:18:27,96 --> 01:18:29,02
胡万！
It's Hu Wan!

1327
01:18:29,32 --> 01:18:30,51
胡…胡万？
Hu Wan?

1328
01:18:30,68 --> 01:18:32,11
怎么会是胡万？
How come it's Hu Wan?

1329
01:18:32,72 --> 01:18:34,23
怪了
This is weird!

1330
01:18:35,72 --> 01:18:36,11
四筒啊
All those wearing "four"

1331
01:18:36,28 --> 01:18:37,34
全是黄家的人！
are my men!

1332
01:18:37,56 --> 01:18:39,55
麻匪呢？
Where are the bandits?

1333
01:18:39,72 --> 01:18:42,55
胡万，就是麻匪！
Where are they?

1334
01:18:39,72 --> 01:18:42,55
Hu Wan was a bandit!


1335
01:18:42,72 --> 01:18:45,02
麻匪，就是胡万！
He was one of them!

1336
01:18:45,56 --> 01:18:48,91
杀县长夫人，绑架豪绅
Murderers and kidnappers,

1337
01:18:49,08 --> 01:18:51,15
祸害鹅城百姓
those who terrorised Goose Town,

1338
01:18:51,32 --> 01:18:54,83
就是你黄老爷家的胡万！
were led by your own Hu Wan!

1339
01:18:55,20 --> 01:18:57,83
我说你为什么不出钱剿匪？
I wondered why you didn't fund the expedition.

1340
01:18:58,00 --> 01:19:01,31
原来你是贼喊捉贼啊！
You may even be the bandit chief himself!

1341
01:19:02,76 --> 01:19:04,19
你拿枪指着我？
You dare to turn your guns on me?

1342
01:19:05,00 --> 01:19:06,51
你拿枪指着我？!
You dare to turn your guns on me?

1343
01:19:07,92 --> 01:19:09,91
你想跟我火拼？
Do you want a shoot-out?

1344
01:27:17,76 --> 01:27:18,39
因为你是好人
Because you're a good person.

1345
01:23:40,00 --> 01:23:41,27
我回来了
I came back alone.

1346
01:23:41,96 --> 01:23:47,23
碰上军阀混战，天下大乱
The country was in total chaos.

1347
01:23:47,92 --> 01:23:51,62
我只得浪迹江湖，落草为寇
So I became a bandit.

1348
01:23:51,84 --> 01:23:55,19
牧之也被叫成了麻子
They nicknamed me "Pocky".

1349
01:23:56,12 --> 01:24:00,43
可惜啊！多好的一个牧字
Shame! You're so handsome.

1350
01:24:00,64 --> 01:24:02,55
人们不愿意相信
People have an odd way of thinking,

1351
01:24:02,92 --> 01:24:06,03
一个土匪的名字叫牧之
that bandits shouldn't have proper names.

1352
01:24:06,36 --> 01:24:08,71
人们更愿意相信他叫麻子
They love calling their bandits "Pocky".

1353
01:24:08,88 --> 01:24:10,79
人们特别愿意相信
Not only that,

1354
01:24:11,56 --> 01:24:15,34
他的脸上应该长着麻子
they want their bandits scarred and scary.

1355
01:24:17,88 --> 01:24:19,67
这人可真够驴蛋的
People can be so ignorant.

1356
01:24:20,88 --> 01:24:24,71
我的故事…却是这样…
My own story started like this...

1357
01:24:25,40 --> 01:24:29,71
那年我也十七岁
I too was a tenderly 17,

1358
01:24:30,16 --> 01:24:32,91
她也十七岁
and so was she.

1359
01:24:33,16 --> 01:24:35,87
停！我不愿意听你的故事
Stop, I'm not interested.

1360
01:24:36,00 --> 01:24:39,99
我一般不跟人说心里话
I don't confess to just anyone.

1361
01:24:40,28 --> 01:24:42,23
这都到嘴边了，你不能让我咽回去吧
I've to continue now that I started.

1362
01:24:42,40 --> 01:24:43,62
咽回去吧
Take it back!

1363
01:24:43,80 --> 01:24:45,83
因为你说出来也是假的
It's all made up anyway.

1364
01:24:46,32 --> 01:24:47,75
你是个骗子
You're a conman!

1365
01:24:52,52 --> 01:24:54,59
北国我不知道
In our part of China,

1366
01:24:56,28 --> 01:25:00,99
在我南国，这样的珍藏版地雷
There are only two such landmines.

1367
01:25:01,56 --> 01:25:02,91
只有两颗
Both limited edition.

1368
01:26:23,12 --> 01:26:24,75
了然，我是假麻子！
No problem, sir. I'm a fake.

1369
01:26:24,92 --> 01:26:27,07
老爷给我多少那是对我的恩赐
I'll take whatever you can spare.

1370
01:26:27,40 --> 01:26:29,23
那么，什么时候炸？
When do you want it to blow up?

1371
01:26:29,40 --> 01:26:31,63
什么时候炸那是第三步
That's our denouement!

1372
01:26:31,96 --> 01:26:35,11
且让我把第二步慢慢走好
Let's play out our second act slowly.

1373
01:26:35,44 --> 01:26:36,55
都别动！
Hold still!

1374
01:26:37,20 --> 01:26:38,26
让她说！
Let her speak.

1375
01:26:38,92 --> 01:26:40,71
老二不辞而别
Two left without saying goodbye.

1376
01:19:44,76 --> 01:19:46,59
你出钱，我剿匪！
why not fund my expedition instead.

1377
01:19:46,80 --> 01:19:47,83
好啊！
Done deal!

1378
01:19:48,60 --> 01:19:53,59
三天之后，一定给县长一个惊喜
You shall receive a nice surprise in 3 days.

1379
01:19:53,76 --> 01:19:56,67
汤师爷，他是胡万的恩人
He was Hu Wan's boss.

1380
01:22:40,20 --> 01:22:43,39
我为什么要把人埋在衙门里
They weren't buried at the magistracy.

1381
01:25:13,08 --> 01:25:17,27
美国制造，一九一零
Made in U.S.A. - 1910!

1382
01:25:18,88 --> 01:25:22,99
呼！一响，它就没了
Bang and everything's in smithereens!

1383
01:25:24,68 --> 01:25:28,67
所以，不带走几条人命
So if it doesn't take some lives with it,

1384
01:25:29,44 --> 01:25:33,35
那就是卑鄙的浪费！
it'd be such a waste.

1385
01:25:33,88 --> 01:25:35,02
那么…
Well...

1386
01:25:35,92 --> 01:25:37,63
另外一颗地雷呢？
where's the other one?

1387
01:25:37,80 --> 01:25:38,51
炸了！
It exploded.

1388
01:25:38,68 --> 01:25:39,23
炸了？
Really?

1389
01:25:39,40 --> 01:25:41,59
辛亥革命的第一响
The first bang during the 1911 Revolution!

1390
01:25:41,76 --> 01:25:43,31
我知道了
Oh yes, I've heard!

1391
01:25:43,52 --> 01:25:45,19
炸在辛亥这个地方了
It went off at Xinhai!

1392
01:25:47,60 --> 01:25:50,75
辛亥不是个地方，是一种革命
Xinhai's not a place! It's a revolutionary icon!

1393
01:25:50,92 --> 01:25:52,71
您要早这么说我就了然了
You should've said so earlier.

1394
01:25:52,88 --> 01:25:54,75
那还是说说这颗吧
Now, tell me about this one.

1395
01:25:54,96 --> 01:25:56,51
谁让你问那颗的？
You must stay focused.

1396
01:25:56,80 --> 01:25:59,31
所以，它要炸得惊天
I want it to shake the world,

1397
01:27:18,60 --> 01:27:19,79
什么？
What?

1398
01:27:20,24 --> 01:27:22,07
这是什么狗屁道理？
What kind of stupid logic is that?

1399
01:27:22,24 --> 01:27:23,99
好人就得让人拿枪指着？
You threaten me because I'm good?

1400
01:27:25,28 --> 01:27:27,19
花姐，大哥说得对！
Flora, Chief is right!

1401
01:27:27,56 --> 01:27:28,95
回来！坐下！
Go back! Sit down!

1402
01:27:29,56 --> 01:27:30,67
你们这群王八蛋
You bunch of idiots!

1403
01:27:30,88 --> 01:27:32,95
我让你们把钱发给穷人
I told you to give money to the poor.

1404
01:27:33,12 --> 01:27:34,03
你们发给一个女人？
And you gave it to her?

1405
01:27:34,16 --> 01:27:36,62
我说什么来着？没人听啊！
I warned you but nobody listened.

1406
01:27:36,80 --> 01:27:38,55
闭嘴！天生的老骗子！
Shut up! You're a born cheat!

1407
01:27:38,72 --> 01:27:40,15
时时刻刻想骗我！
Always plotting to swindle me.

1408
01:27:40,32 --> 01:27:42,15
跟黄四郎勾勾搭搭！
Working with Huang behind my back.

1409
01:27:42,32 --> 01:27:44,39
一个土匪碰见一个恶霸
When a bandit confronts a godfather,

1410
01:27:44,60 --> 01:27:45,79
多么简单的事！
the outcome should be simple.

1411
01:27:45,96 --> 01:27:47,91
让你们给弄成这么烂七八糟的
How can you screw up so badly?

1412
01:22:23,16 --> 01:22:26,07
狸猫变太子，嘎登变出一胡万来
Abracadabra, and Hu Wan magically appeared!

1413
01:22:26,76 --> 01:22:28,67
可是我有一事不明
But I really didn't get it.

1414
01:22:29,52 --> 01:22:30,55
六具尸体
Those six bodies,

1415
01:22:30,76 --> 01:22:32,35
这么长的距离，那么短的时间
such a distance, so little time,

1416
01:22:32,56 --> 01:22:34,71
还抹着红脸蛋，你们是怎么搬来的？
how did you move them so quickly?

1417
01:22:34,88 --> 01:22:37,03
我跟黄四郎可是一路小跑过来的
Huang and I took the shortcut.

1418
01:22:37,20 --> 01:22:38,23
你们搬着六个人
You've to carry six bodies.

1419
01:22:38,40 --> 01:22:39,87
来不及呀！
How did you manage?

1420
01:23:09,60 --> 01:23:11,11
好名字！
A fine name!

1421
01:23:11,28 --> 01:23:13,51
充州牧，豫州牧
It has auspicious meanings.

1422
01:23:13,80 --> 01:23:18,07
牧之，令尊是望子成大器
You father must have high hopes.

1423
01:23:18,60 --> 01:23:20,11
从讲武堂出来
After graduating from military academy,

1424
01:23:20,92 --> 01:23:23,91
我追随过松坡将军
I enlisted in General Cai's army.

1425
01:23:24,36 --> 01:23:26,39
给他做过手枪队长
Served as captain of his riflemen.

1426
01:23:26,76 --> 01:23:28,07
那年你多大？
How old were you then?

1427
01:23:28,24 --> 01:23:29,51
十七
Seventeen.

1428
01:23:29,80 --> 01:23:31,71
少年得志啊
A youthful genius!

1429
01:23:32,36 --> 01:23:36,11
后来庐州会战，将军负了伤
Cai was wounded during the Battle of Luzhou,

1430
01:23:36,88 --> 01:23:39,79
再后来，将军死在了日本
and later died in exile in Japan.

1431
01:27:50,04 --> 01:27:51,51
不敢拿枪，当不了麻匪
If I don't dare to draw a gun on you,

1432
01:27:51,68 --> 01:27:53,35
我敢拿枪指着你
I'll never make a good bandit.

1433
01:27:54,12 --> 01:27:55,18
我胆儿大吧
I dare you all!

1434
01:27:59,00 --> 01:28:00,79
你们谁给她出的这个主意？
Whose quirky idea is this?

1435
01:28:01,24 --> 01:28:02,35
谁？
Whose?

1436
01:28:03,28 --> 01:28:04,91
我就是跟她说着玩的
I was just teasing her.

1437
01:28:10,52 --> 01:28:11,95
你是想当麻匪？
You want to become one of us?

1438
01:28:12,12 --> 01:28:14,99
对呀！我想跟你们一块儿发钱
Yes, to give money out to the poor,

1439
01:28:15,16 --> 01:28:18,07
把钱袋子扔到窗户里，听他们笑
to hear and share their joy.

1440
01:28:20,56 --> 01:28:21,39
你现在就是了
You're now one of us.

1441
01:28:21,60 --> 01:28:22,74
我还没准备好呢
But I am not prepared.

1442
01:28:22,96 --> 01:28:23,99
不用准备
No need!

1443
01:28:24,16 --> 01:28:25,35
你们都准备过吗？
Did you make preparation?

1444
01:28:25,56 --> 01:28:26,39
没有
No.

1445
01:28:26,60 --> 01:28:27,19
你准备过吗？
How about you?

1446
01:28:27,36 --> 01:28:29,51
没有啊，我吃着火锅唱着歌
I was eating hotpot and singing songs.

1447
01:28:29,68 --> 01:28:32,35
扑通一下掉水里，出来就到这儿了
My train plunged and I ended up here.

1448
01:28:35,92 --> 01:28:37,59
我们要离开鹅城
We're leaving Goose Town soon.

1449
01:28:37,96 --> 01:28:38,75
你就留在鹅城
But you have to stay.

1450
01:28:38,92 --> 01:28:39,83
不！
No.

1451
01:28:40,68 --> 01:28:42,35
当麻匪要听命令
A bandit must have discipline.

1452
01:28:42,56 --> 01:28:43,95
大哥说得对
Chief is right.

1453
01:28:45,40 --> 01:28:46,87
刚才说的也对
But she has a point, too.

1454
01:28:53,04 --> 01:28:55,31
我有个很重要的事交给你
I have an important mission for you.

1455
01:28:56,04 --> 01:28:57,83
我看你挺合适
I think you can manage.

1456
01:28:58,84 --> 01:29:00,35
这就是惊喜！
This is our nice surprise!

1457
01:29:01,32 --> 01:29:02,91
果然是个惊京喜
A nice surprise indeed.

1458
01:29:03,80 --> 01:29:05,15
果然他不姓马！
He is not Ma!

1459
01:29:09,28 --> 01:29:10,75
有了这个惊喜
Now that we know,

1460
01:29:13,00 --> 01:29:17,23
我的第二步就能走的更加悠然
My next move can be more leisurely.

1461
01:29:17,40 --> 01:29:18,79
悠然？
Leisurely?

1462
01:29:19,84 --> 01:29:22,27
盗官欺爵，放在前清
Impersonating a governor warrants capital punishment.

1463
01:25:59,52 --> 01:26:02,95
还要动地，还要泣鬼神
I want it to rock and roll!

1464
01:26:03,16 --> 01:26:03,87
了然
Understood.

1465
01:26:04,04 --> 01:26:05,23
选个好地方
Pick a good spot,

1466
01:26:05,96 --> 01:26:07,31
选个好时辰
find an auspicious time...

1467
01:26:07,52 --> 01:26:09,31
那么…炸谁？
So, who's our target?

1468
01:26:09,52 --> 01:26:10,74
你应该问…
You should've asked...

1469
01:26:10,92 --> 01:26:11,67
炸在哪
"Where"?

1470
01:26:11,84 --> 01:26:13,15
炸在哪？
Where, then?

1471
01:26:13,84 --> 01:26:15,27
剿匪的路上
Where the expedition force must pass.

1472
01:26:15,64 --> 01:26:17,94
这么快又要剿匪了？
Yet another expedition?

1473
01:26:18,20 --> 01:26:19,79
那这回我能多分点吧
Can I have a bigger cut this time?

1474
01:26:20,00 --> 01:26:22,95
你要是真的张麻子，钱都给你
You can have it all if you're the real Pocky!

1475
01:27:07,44 --> 01:27:09,74
你是被黄四郎买来的
You were bought by Huang?

1476
01:27:09,92 --> 01:27:10,51
对
Yes.

1477
01:27:10,68 --> 01:27:11,82
他打过你吗？ 打过
- Been mistreated? - Yes.

1478
01:27:12,04 --> 01:27:13,15
我打过你么？ 没有
- Have I ever laid hands on you? - No.

1479
01:27:13,32 --> 01:27:14,38
你恨他吗？ 恨
- Hate him? - Yes.

1480
01:27:14,60 --> 01:27:15,39
恨我吗？ 不恨
- And me? - No.

1481
01:27:15,60 --> 01:27:17,59
那你不拿枪指着他！你拿枪指着我？
Then why threaten me with a gun?

1482
01:38:18,12 --> 01:38:23,91
“大哥有令，散开，别开枪”
"Hold your fire. Scatter!"

1483
01:38:24,08 --> 01:38:30,83
“往山顶上跑，抓住他们的头儿”
"Run for the peak. Grab their leader."

1484
01:38:36,72 --> 01:38:37,63
西边十个
10 to the west.

1485
01:38:38,16 --> 01:38:39,22
南面六个
6 to the south.

1486
01:29:30,36 --> 01:29:32,95
我还要好好地耍耍这两只猴！
I want to toy with these circus monkeys.

1487
01:29:33,16 --> 01:29:34,27
我的老爷
But Master,

1488
01:29:34,68 --> 01:29:36,59
这两只猴子不值得您耍！
they're not worth your while.

1489
01:29:36,76 --> 01:29:39,27
要耍！一定要耍！
No, I must toy with them!

1490
01:29:39,72 --> 01:29:42,95
不耍猴，我怎么赚到两大家族的钱？
Otherwise, I couldn't get others to pay,

1491
01:29:43,12 --> 01:29:47,15
不耍猴，他们怎么心甘情愿地去剿匪？
the Governor couldn't go and fight the bandits,

1492
01:29:47,40 --> 01:29:51,71
不剿匪，他们怎么能踩到地雷呢？
and they wouldn't trot on my landmine!

1493
01:29:52,08 --> 01:29:53,30
黄四郎有个替身
Huang has a double.

1494
01:29:53,52 --> 01:29:54,83
跟他长得一模一样
They are indistinguishable.

1495
01:29:55,00 --> 01:29:59,07
我弄不清楚他是黄四郎，还是他替身
I can't tell if this is really Huang.

1496
01:29:59,76 --> 01:30:00,82
你帮我去看看
I need you to check for me.

1497
01:30:05,08 --> 01:30:06,06
假的！
He's a fake.

1498
01:30:06,76 --> 01:30:08,07
他不是黄四郎
He's not Huang.

1499
01:30:08,24 --> 01:30:10,27
我已经跟你们说过我不是他
Told you I'm not Huang!

1500
01:30:10,44 --> 01:30:12,39
我真的不是他
I really am not him.

1501
01:30:12,40 --> 01:30:13,23
肯定不是
I'm certain.

1502
01:30:13,40 --> 01:30:14,87
放了我吧，放了我
Let me go.

1503
01:30:15,04 --> 01:30:17,11
那好，你帮我们看住他
Keep an eye on him until our return.

1504
01:30:17,28 --> 01:30:19,91
等我们回来，就用你手里的枪
If you have to, use your guns.

1505
01:31:46,92 --> 01:31:49,83
黄老爷见笑，马某走南闯北
I've travelled all over China,

1506
01:31:50,00 --> 01:31:52,07
在九个地方做过县长
I have been governor in 9 counties.

1507
01:31:52,24 --> 01:31:56,27
靠的就是以假乱真、鱼目混珠之章法
I excel in confusing facts with fiction!

1508
01:31:56,52 --> 01:31:58,15
那么…马县长…
So, Governor Ma...

1509
01:31:58,32 --> 01:31:59,23
你说
Yes?

1510
01:31:59,96 --> 01:32:01,31
叫我呐！
He's addressing me.

1511
01:32:02,04 --> 01:32:03,02
黄老爷继续
You were saying?

1512
01:32:03,20 --> 01:32:05,19
我刚摸清你们的底细
Just as I uncover the truth,

1513
01:32:05,84 --> 01:32:07,71
你们就不打自招
you blow your own cover!

1514
01:32:08,04 --> 01:32:08,63
太巧了吧？
What a coincidence.

1515
01:32:08,80 --> 01:32:13,11
有道是，展颜消宿怨
"Stop frowning to dispel ill feelings,

1516
01:32:13,28 --> 01:32:15,15
一笑泯恩仇啊
and brush aside quarrels with a smile."

1517
01:32:15,32 --> 01:32:16,79
你想跟我和解？
Want to make peace?

1518
01:32:17,40 --> 01:32:19,11
好啊！我的替身呢？
Splendid. Where's my double?

1519
01:32:19,84 --> 01:32:22,27
还给我，前面的账一笔勾销
Return him and we'll call it quits.

1520
01:32:22,44 --> 01:32:23,63
撕票了
We've killed him.

1521
01:32:24,40 --> 01:32:26,43
哪个王八蛋让你撕票的？
Which asshole ordered his execution?

1522
01:32:26,64 --> 01:32:28,39
你个王八蛋让我撕票的！
You're that asshole!

1523
01:32:31,08 --> 01:32:32,91
开枪，你开枪我也能先打死你
I dare you to pull your trigger!

1524
01:32:33,80 --> 01:32:34,55
放下！
Lay down your guns!

1525
01:32:34,96 --> 01:32:37,15
开枪！你先开枪，我也能先打死你
I know I could take you out first.

1526
01:32:38,40 --> 01:32:41,19
把枪放下！我数三下
Put down your guns on my count of three!

1527
01:32:41,36 --> 01:32:44,07
一！二！三！
One, two, three!

1528
01:32:45,96 --> 01:32:47,27
老黄，你先放下
Huang, put it down!

1529
01:32:47,52 --> 01:32:49,15
他不懂事儿，你也不懂事啊？
He may be a brute, but you too?

1530
01:26:41,64 --> 01:26:43,23
老三又要走了
Now Three is leaving too.

1531
01:26:43,44 --> 01:26:45,27
我们活活的被你们拆散了！
You are tearing us apart!

1532
01:26:46,72 --> 01:26:49,31
女侠，你是为了老二还是为老三啊？
You're doing this for Two or Three?

1533
01:26:49,52 --> 01:26:50,87
闭嘴！
Shut up!

1534
01:26:52,12 --> 01:26:53,43
你左手的意思我懂
I know your left hand's intention,

1535
01:26:53,64 --> 01:26:54,83
右手的意思我也懂
I know your right hand's intention.

1536
01:26:55,00 --> 01:26:56,91
两只手这么待着，我看不懂
But both hands together...I don't get it.

1537
01:26:57,08 --> 01:26:58,79
要么成，要么死
I'd rather be dead!

1538
01:26:58,96 --> 01:26:59,75
AB型！
Typical Scorpian!

1539
01:27:00,32 --> 01:27:01,35
闭嘴！
Shut up!

1540
01:27:02,52 --> 01:27:03,58
你们都坐下
Sit down, all of you.

1541
01:27:04,12 --> 01:27:05,43
我再跟她聊聊
Let me talk to her.

1542
01:27:48,08 --> 01:27:49,75
你还敢拿枪指着我？
How dare you still point your gun at me?

1543
01:29:22,44 --> 01:29:24,15
满门抄斩
His whole clan dies with him!

1544
01:29:24,32 --> 01:29:25,87
老爷，你等着
Master, just you wait.

1545
01:29:26,52 --> 01:29:27,74
我这就一枪崩了他！
I'll go and blow him away!

1546
01:29:27,92 --> 01:29:28,98
不！
No!

1547
01:29:29,16 --> 01:29:30,19
他们死以前
Before they die,

1548
01:40:37,08 --> 01:40:38,19
死了吧？
Is he dead?

1549
01:40:45,00 --> 01:40:47,19
我弄死你妈的呀！
Goddamned it!

1550
01:32:58,72 --> 01:33:00,11
出不了城，剿不了匪
We can't fight without leaving!

1551
01:33:00,60 --> 01:33:02,83
黄老爷，您说话不算数啊！
You've failed to live up to your promise.

1552
01:33:03,00 --> 01:33:04,35
鸿门宴上说得好
You had agreed to

1553
01:33:04,56 --> 01:33:05,70
你带头出钱
Iead the contribution

1554
01:33:05,88 --> 01:33:07,75
再套出两大家族的钱来
in order to make the others pay.

1555
01:33:07,92 --> 01:33:09,55
可是你不但不出钱
Not only have you not put up any money,

1556
01:33:09,72 --> 01:33:12,95
还扮成麻匪跟我们打来打去，不仗义啊
you've also fought us posing as bandits!

1557
01:33:13,08 --> 01:33:16,31
错！你们看见的麻匪，是我扮的
Wrong! You saw my men dressed up as bandits.

1558
01:33:17,00 --> 01:33:18,87
我看见的麻匪，是你们扮的
I saw yours posing as bandits, too.

1559
01:33:19,08 --> 01:33:20,51
可是他们看见的麻匪
But when the others see these bandits,

1560
01:33:20,68 --> 01:33:22,43
他们以为是真的！
they wouldn't know that they're fakes.

1561
01:33:22,68 --> 01:33:25,91
现在正是让他们出钱剿匪的好时机！
Now is the time to pay for the expedition.

1562
01:33:26,08 --> 01:33:28,43
只要我出钱，他们一定会出
If I pay, others will follow suit.

1563
01:33:28,64 --> 01:33:30,07
你的钱呢？
Where's your money?

1564
01:33:38,80 --> 01:33:40,83
早已经为你准备好了
It's all here.

1565
01:33:41,32 --> 01:33:43,03
鹅城到处都是我的钱
I've money stowed away everywhere!

1566
01:33:43,36 --> 01:33:44,58
都在这儿？
It's all here?

1567
01:33:44,76 --> 01:33:46,19
这只是一半
This is only half of my share.

1568
01:33:46,44 --> 01:33:50,43
我们想赚多少，他们必须出多少
Each family will have to put up the same.

1569
01:33:50,64 --> 01:33:51,86
三舅，有诈！
Uncle, this is a trap.

1570
01:33:52,80 --> 01:33:53,78
诈？
A trap?

1571
01:33:55,16 --> 01:33:56,91
来回这么多趟，死了这么多人
After all these confrontations,

1572
01:33:57,08 --> 01:33:57,91
他一分钱都不出
he has not put up a dime.

1573
01:33:58,08 --> 01:33:59,99
今天怎么突然出了这么多钱？
Why so generous all of a sudden?

1574
01:34:00,16 --> 01:34:01,19
你觉得突然？
Did I surprise you?

1575
01:34:02,04 --> 01:34:02,63
太突然了
Yes, you did.

1576
01:34:02,80 --> 01:34:04,02
我也觉得突然
I surprised myself too!

1577
01:34:04,32 --> 01:34:05,27
想知道吗？
Want to know why?

1578
01:34:05,76 --> 01:34:06,82
过来
Come here.

1579
01:34:09,00 --> 01:34:10,79
我要当…
I - want - to - be -

1580
01:34:11,16 --> 01:34:11,79
县长
Governor!

1581
01:34:11,96 --> 01:34:13,02
你？
You?

1582
01:34:13,16 --> 01:34:14,67
我做不了县长？
I won't make a Governor?

1583
01:34:15,60 --> 01:34:16,79
我不像个县长？
Don't I look the part?

1584
01:34:16,96 --> 01:34:19,55
像！我们一走，你就上任鹅城
Yes, you can swear in as soon as we leave.

1585
01:34:19,72 --> 01:34:21,15
鹅城？
Goose Town?

1586
01:34:22,32 --> 01:34:24,11
我买了六个县的县长！
I bought governorship of 6 more counties!

1587
01:34:24,28 --> 01:34:26,51
我一个人当不过来
I can't handle all on my own!

1588
01:34:27,04 --> 01:34:28,15
所以…
That is why...

1589
01:34:28,36 --> 01:34:29,42
出去
Get out!

1590
01:34:29,96 --> 01:34:31,31
退下
Leave us.

1591
01:34:32,40 --> 01:34:35,23
老马，你来帮我当三个县的县长
I need you to govern three of them for me.

1592
01:34:35,40 --> 01:34:37,67
好啊！这事我拿手
Brilliant! I'm good at governing.

1593
01:34:37,88 --> 01:34:38,99
等会！
Hey, wait...

1594
01:34:39,16 --> 01:34:41,19
那…那我干什么呀？
What about me, then?

1595
01:34:41,36 --> 01:34:42,55
你嘛…
You...

1596
01:34:43,60 --> 01:34:45,63
来当一个假的张麻子！
can play "Pocky" Zhang!

1597
01:34:47,72 --> 01:34:48,91
好啊
Great idea!

1598
01:35:23,96 --> 01:35:25,83
自宣统皇帝退位以后
Since the abdication of the last Emperor,

1599
01:35:26,84 --> 01:35:29,11
鹅城一共来过51任县长
Goose Town has 51 governors.

1600
01:35:29,24 --> 01:35:33,59
他们都是王八蛋、禽兽、畜生、寄生虫
They're all bastards, parasites and leeches!

1601
01:35:33,76 --> 01:35:36,75
但是这位马邦德县长
But our beloved Governor Ma,

1602
01:35:37,04 --> 01:35:39,07
他不是王八蛋，不是畜生
is neither a bastard, parasite,

1603
01:35:39,24 --> 01:35:41,70
不是禽兽，也不是寄生虫
Ieech, nor a beast!

1604
01:38:01,20 --> 01:38:03,07
张麻子一来，你我可就没命了
We're doomed if we run into him!

1605
01:38:03,96 --> 01:38:08,27
张麻子！…
Speak of the devil!

1606
01:38:14,04 --> 01:38:15,59
告诉弟兄们，散开
Tell our men to hold their fire!

1607
01:38:15,84 --> 01:38:17,71
别开枪，往山顶上跑
Scatter! Run for the peak.

1608
01:30:20,24 --> 01:30:21,79
我不会用枪
I've never used a gun.

1609
01:30:22,12 --> 01:30:23,59
老三，你教教她
Three, show her how.

1610
01:30:41,80 --> 01:30:43,27
这照片是你吗？
Is that your photo?

1611
01:30:43,60 --> 01:30:44,43
是我！
Yes, it's mine.

1612
01:30:45,04 --> 01:30:45,83
是吗？
Sure?

1613
01:30:46,00 --> 01:30:47,11
是
Yes,

1614
01:30:48,00 --> 01:30:50,27
那时候我还很瘦
I was slimmer then.

1615
01:30:50,76 --> 01:30:52,07
这就不是你
I don't think it's you.

1616
01:30:52,36 --> 01:30:53,55
你说他不是我？
It isn't?

1617
01:30:53,80 --> 01:30:54,59
不是！
No, it isn't.

1618
01:30:54,76 --> 01:30:56,23
我说他也不是我！
I don't think so either.

1619
01:30:56,40 --> 01:30:58,63
这根本就不是我！
No, that ain't me.

1620
01:30:59,84 --> 01:31:01,03
那到底是怎么回事？
What is this all about?

1621
01:31:01,20 --> 01:31:03,15
我还想知道是怎么回事
I was totally baffled myself.

1622
01:31:03,68 --> 01:31:07,27
花钱买了个县官，我总得有个证件吧
When I bought the post, I needed papers.

1623
01:31:07,96 --> 01:31:10,87
我去照相馆照相，取照片的时候
I had my picture taken at a gallery,

1624
01:31:11,20 --> 01:31:12,55
他们给我的就是这张
and that's what they gave me.

1625
01:31:12,72 --> 01:31:14,91
我说这不是我，他们说这就是你
I said the man in the photo wasn't me.

1626
01:31:15,24 --> 01:31:18,75
我说他不是我！他们说这就是你
They insisted that it was.

1627
01:31:19,12 --> 01:31:20,83
没办法，我就把它贴在这了
I've no choice but to use it.

1628
01:31:21,32 --> 01:31:22,51
哦！是这样！
Is that so?

1629
01:31:22,80 --> 01:31:24,27
哦什么呀？
Bullshit!

1630
01:31:24,68 --> 01:31:26,51
这明明是我！
That's obviously me!

1631
01:31:27,12 --> 01:31:28,71
我才是马邦德！
I am the real Ma Bangde.

1632
01:31:29,20 --> 01:31:31,19
哦！是这样
Is that so?

1633
01:31:31,32 --> 01:31:34,94
是这样！我进城以前遇见麻匪
I was ambushed by bandits on my way here.

1634
01:31:35,52 --> 01:31:37,67
幸亏有他，才躲过一劫
He saved my life.

1635
01:31:37,84 --> 01:31:40,63
我一想，索性让他假扮县长
So I let him take the post.

1636
01:31:40,80 --> 01:31:43,39
毕竟是自家外甥嘛
After all, he's my nephew.

1637
01:31:43,60 --> 01:31:44,95
三舅，这话能跟他说吗？
Uncle, we shouldn't be telling him this.

1638
01:31:45,12 --> 01:31:46,18
闭嘴！
Shut up!

1639
01:36:12,44 --> 01:36:15,91
出了城，吃着火锅，还唱着歌
singing, eating hot pot and be merry,

1640
01:36:16,08 --> 01:36:19,27
突然就被麻匪劫了！
when bandits jump on you from nowhere!

1641
01:36:20,04 --> 01:36:22,27
所以，没有麻匪的日子
I long for a world without thieves,

1642
01:36:22,68 --> 01:36:24,55
才是好日子！
for days of wine and roses!

1643
01:36:25,88 --> 01:36:26,99
县长，请！
Governor, please!

1644
01:36:29,16 --> 01:36:31,35
出发！
March!

1645
01:36:46,20 --> 01:36:46,99
恩人
Saviour,

1646
01:36:47,28 --> 01:36:48,67
给你看个宝贝
want to check this out?

1647
01:36:50,16 --> 01:36:51,19
这不就是委任状嘛
Isn't that the warrant?

1648
01:36:51,32 --> 01:36:52,67
念念，念念
Read it out loud.

1649
01:36:54,20 --> 01:36:56,79
兹委任马邦德…怎么了？
Ma Bangde is hereby appointed...

1650
01:36:56,96 --> 01:36:57,83
后面！
Read on!

1651
01:36:58,00 --> 01:36:59,71
中华民国八年八月…
8th month of the 8th year of the Republic...

1652
01:36:59,88 --> 01:37:01,23
念你没念过的字，当中！
Don't miss out the words in between...

1653
01:37:01,40 --> 01:37:04,79
兹委任马邦德为康城县长…
Ma Bangde is hereby appointed Kang County governor...

1654
01:37:05,56 --> 01:37:06,35
等会…
Hang on...

1655
01:37:07,52 --> 01:37:08,43
康城？
Kang County?

1656
01:37:09,56 --> 01:37:10,51
不是鹅城吗？
Not Goose Town?

1657
01:37:10,68 --> 01:37:12,27
从来都是康城
It has always been Kang County.

1658
01:37:12,44 --> 01:37:12,99
好小子
You bastard!

1659
01:37:13,16 --> 01:37:14,07
怨你啊
Blame yourself!

1660
01:37:14,24 --> 01:37:16,99
你把我泡水里，九筒扣脸上
When you dumped me in the river,

1661
01:37:17,20 --> 01:37:19,58
闹钟咔咔咔响，吓死我了！
scared as I was, I had an inspired moment.

1662
01:37:19,76 --> 01:37:22,32
我灵机一动，让你去鹅城
I brought you to Goose Town.

1663
01:37:22,52 --> 01:37:25,87
这鹅城和康城有什么不一样啊？
What's their difference?

1664
01:37:26,04 --> 01:37:28,71
康城富饶，鹅城凶险
Kang County is affluent. Goose Town is deadly.

1665
01:37:28,88 --> 01:37:30,31
那你为什么让我去啊？
Why Goose Town for me?

1666
01:37:30,52 --> 01:37:32,07
你鬼扯叹，截火车！
You're a tough cookie, aren't you?

1667
01:37:32,24 --> 01:37:36,02
告诉你啊，你进了鹅城就有两种情况
There can only be two outcomes.

1668
01:37:36,24 --> 01:37:39,23
第一，你进城就被黄四郎弄死
Either Huang kills you dead,

1669
01:40:51,52 --> 01:40:53,95
告诉弟兄们，上东边去
Tell everyone to go east.

1670
01:40:54,88 --> 01:40:56,43
抓着活的，问出他们头在哪
Bring one in for interrogation.

1671
01:40:56,64 --> 01:40:57,75
我亲手宰了他！
I'll kill their leader myself.

1672
01:40:58,96 --> 01:40:59,99
上东边
Let's move.

1673
01:41:05,40 --> 01:41:05,83
头在哪儿？
Where's your leader?

1674
01:41:06,00 --> 01:41:07,55
北面，脸上有麻子的就是
In the north, with a pockmarked face.

1675
01:41:07,76 --> 01:41:08,90
北面！山顶上
Go north! On the hill.

1676
01:41:14,40 --> 01:41:14,87
我没死吧？
Am I dead?

1677
01:41:15,04 --> 01:41:15,91
没有！没死！
No, you're still alive.

1678
01:41:16,08 --> 01:41:18,19
没死！要说什么？我帮你吹
Do you want to signal a message?

1679
01:41:19,60 --> 01:41:20,79
怎么吹？怎么吹？
How do you whistle?

1680
01:41:30,76 --> 01:41:31,51
你带我走吧！
Can you lead the way?

1681
01:41:31,68 --> 01:41:33,55
不…跑不动！…
No, I can't run any more.

1682
01:41:33,72 --> 01:41:34,23
我带你走
Follow me, then.

1683
01:41:34,40 --> 01:41:35,62
跑不动…！
I can't run.

1684
01:41:35,80 --> 01:41:36,94
不是嘴坏了吗？
You've only blown up your cheeks.

1685
01:41:37,44 --> 01:41:39,11
嘴坏了用脚跑啊！
Your legs are fine.

1686
01:41:40,76 --> 01:41:46,07
“大哥死了，大哥死了”
"Chief is dead! Chief is dead!"

1687
01:41:47,40 --> 01:41:48,31
大哥死了？
The Chief is dead?

1688
01:41:50,80 --> 01:41:52,15
你把大哥给吹死了
You just signalled the Chief's death!

1689
01:41:52,68 --> 01:41:54,19
老五，你去看看
Five, go check it out.

1690
01:41:55,80 --> 01:41:56,86
大哥
Chief!

1691
01:41:57,64 --> 01:41:58,62
大哥
Chief!

1692
01:41:59,36 --> 01:42:00,42
大哥
Chief!

1693
01:42:01,20 --> 01:42:02,15
他们说你死了！
They said you're dead.

1694
01:42:02,28 --> 01:42:05,15
放他妈的屁！我这不还活着吗？
Bullshit! Am I not alive?

1695
01:42:05,56 --> 01:42:07,79
“大哥没死”
"Chief is alive and well!"

1696
01:42:08,76 --> 01:42:10,15
放他妈的屁怎么没吹啊？
Why missed out signalling "bullshit"?

1697
01:42:10,28 --> 01:42:11,95
“放你妈的屁”
"You're full of shit!"

1698
01:42:12,12 --> 01:42:13,15
听见没
Hear that?

1699
01:42:14,28 --> 01:42:15,91
骂咱们放你娘的屁呢！
He said we're full of shit.

1700
01:42:18,08 --> 01:42:19,11
等会儿
Wait.

1701
01:32:52,80 --> 01:32:54,07
你最不懂事！
You're the worst!

1702
01:32:54,56 --> 01:32:55,75
你们什么时候出城剿匪？
When are you leaving for your expedition?

1703
01:32:55,96 --> 01:32:56,99
走不了
We aren't.

1704
01:32:57,24 --> 01:32:58,55
钱不到手，出不了城
We can't leave without funding.

1705
01:53:39,44 --> 01:53:41,11
枪在手，跟我走！
Those with guns follow me.

1706
01:53:41,28 --> 01:53:48,19
杀四郎，抢碉楼！
Kill Huang and storm his citadel...

1707
01:53:48,88 --> 01:53:50,31
枪在手，跟我走！
Those with guns follow me.

1708
01:53:50,52 --> 01:53:55,95
杀四郎，抢碉楼！
Kill Huang and storm his citadel...

1709
01:53:56,12 --> 01:53:57,71
枪在手，跟我走！
Those with guns follow me.

1710
01:53:57,88 --> 01:54:02,43
杀四郎，抢碉楼！
Kill Huang and storm his citadel...

1711
01:54:09,84 --> 01:54:11,55
枪在手，跟我走！
Those with guns follow me.

1712
01:56:57,72 --> 01:56:58,35
去看看
Go and take a look.

1713
01:56:58,56 --> 01:56:59,78
要出人命啦！
Someone will die!

1714
01:43:33,24 --> 01:43:34,35
东边…
East...

1715
01:43:44,44 --> 01:43:47,07
你到底是不是张麻子？
Are you really "Pocky" Zhang?

1716
01:43:47,28 --> 01:43:48,11
我是
Yes, I am.

1717
01:43:48,28 --> 01:43:50,91
我可是快要死的人了
I am about to kick the bucket,

1718
01:43:51,64 --> 01:43:53,35
别骗我
don't lie to me.

1719
01:43:53,92 --> 01:43:55,11
放心
Don't worry.

1720
01:43:56,00 --> 01:43:57,43
我就是张麻子
I really am "Pocky" Zhang.

1721
01:43:58,40 --> 01:44:00,70
麻子
Pocky!

1722
01:44:00,88 --> 01:44:02,91
屁股…
My ass...

1723
01:44:03,52 --> 01:44:05,71
屁股疼
it hurts.

1724
01:44:08,16 --> 01:44:09,30
师爷
Counselor.

1725
01:44:09,88 --> 01:44:11,55
屁股在树上呢
Your ass is on that tree.

1726
01:44:12,24 --> 01:44:13,59
不疼了
You can't feel it.

1727
01:44:16,40 --> 01:44:21,63
我树上的屁股的口袋里
On my ass over there,

1728
01:44:21,80 --> 01:44:23,99
有五张委任状
I have another five warrants.

1729
01:44:24,52 --> 01:44:26,27
都给你
Take them.

1730
01:44:26,80 --> 01:44:31,23
听我的，千万别回鹅城
Promise never to return to Goose Town.

1731
01:44:31,72 --> 01:44:36,35
你呀，弄不过黄四郎
You can't beat Huang.

1732
01:44:36,56 --> 01:44:39,75
带上银子，走吧
Take the money and run.

1733
01:44:40,12 --> 01:44:42,50
你放心，我不回鹅城
Don't worry, I won't go back.

1734
01:44:42,80 --> 01:44:48,55
其实，我还有两档子事儿骗过你
I lied about two other things.

1735
01:44:49,24 --> 01:44:50,59
骗了就骗了吧
No big deal.

1736
01:44:50,76 --> 01:44:52,27
不行
No.

1737
01:44:52,96 --> 01:44:56,95
我死之前，我必须告诉你
I must confess before I die.

1738
01:44:57,12 --> 01:44:59,35
你说，头一档子
What was the first lie, then?

1739
01:44:59,72 --> 01:45:03,99
我…我能说这第二档子事儿吗？
Can I confess my second lie first?

1740
01:45:04,16 --> 01:45:05,30
好
Yes.

1741
01:45:05,56 --> 01:45:09,31
那谁…你还记得吗？
Do you still remember...

1742
01:48:07,72 --> 01:48:09,71
咱们一个字，斩！
We simply want them...dead!

1743
01:48:10,04 --> 01:48:11,35
可他说过
He has sworn publicly,

1744
01:48:12,36 --> 01:48:14,27
三天之后斩我人头
to behead me in 3 days.

1745
01:48:14,44 --> 01:48:17,71
荆柯当年还说要斩秦始皇呢
Some said I'd win the lottery too!

1746
01:48:22,16 --> 01:48:23,87
大哥，三天
Can the four of us

1747
01:48:24,36 --> 01:48:26,19
就我们四个要杀黄四郎？
kill Huang in three days?

1748
01:48:26,88 --> 01:48:27,27
对
Yes.

1749
01:48:27,44 --> 01:48:28,50
还把话说出去了
We've been telling everyone that.

1750
01:48:28,68 --> 01:48:31,14
话不说出去，事就办不成
We can't back out now!

1751
01:48:31,32 --> 01:48:32,51
胜算有几成啊？
What are our chances?

1752
01:48:33,84 --> 01:48:34,75
“三成”
"30%"

1753
01:48:34,96 --> 01:48:36,43
三成不是玩命吗？
30%? Are we out of our mind?

1754
01:48:37,72 --> 01:48:39,71
我去睡会儿啊，你们在这盯着
Time for a nap. Keep watch.

1755
01:48:53,72 --> 01:48:54,19
南风
Queen!

1756
01:48:54,36 --> 01:48:54,95
北风
Knave!

1757
01:48:55,12 --> 01:48:56,43
胡啦
Bingo!

1758
01:48:57,72 --> 01:48:58,78
大哥，银子都没了！
Chief, the money is gone.

1759
01:48:58,96 --> 01:48:59,59
我看见了
I could see that.

1760
01:48:59,76 --> 01:49:00,74
现在有四成了吧
We must have a 40% chance now!

1761
01:49:00,92 --> 01:49:01,59
五成？
50%?

1762
01:49:01,76 --> 01:49:02,74
七成？
70%?

1763
01:49:03,44 --> 01:49:04,19
不能吧
Surely not!

1764
01:49:04,36 --> 01:49:06,63
老百姓把钱都拿回家了，还三成啊？
Still only 30% after they took the money?

1765
01:49:06,80 --> 01:49:08,23
银子要是这么被拿走了
If things are that simple,

1766
01:49:08,40 --> 01:49:09,75
那钱就白发了
our efforts will be in vain.

1767
01:49:11,00 --> 01:49:11,91
出车！
Send the carriages!

1768
01:49:16,96 --> 01:49:19,71
我要你看一看，什么叫做草船借箭
I'll show you how to "borrow arrows with a straw boat"!

1769
01:35:41,88 --> 01:35:45,75
他今天亲自带队，出兵剿匪
He risks his life to combat the bandits.

1770
01:35:46,12 --> 01:35:49,39
他是我们的大英雄
He is our hero!

1771
01:35:52,68 --> 01:35:53,90
师爷，请！
Counselor, please.

1772
01:35:56,88 --> 01:36:00,03
大风起兮云飞扬
It's time for heroes to take centre stage!

1773
01:36:00,24 --> 01:36:03,39
安得猛士兮走四方
It's time for heroes to show their mettle!

1774
01:36:03,60 --> 01:36:07,07
麻匪，任何时候都要剿
We must rid ourselves of these bandits.

1775
01:36:07,28 --> 01:36:08,79
不剿不行
We don't have a choice.

1776
01:36:09,00 --> 01:36:11,79
你们想想，你带着老婆
Imagine, if you take your wife out,

1777
01:37:39,40 --> 01:37:41,31
我马走康城，从容上任
and I'll move on to Kang County.

1778
01:37:41,52 --> 01:37:44,35
第二，你有种，咱俩办了黄四郎
Or we sort out Huang instead,

1779
01:37:44,56 --> 01:37:45,78
就像现在这样
Iike what's happening now.

1780
01:37:45,96 --> 01:37:47,91
好！说得好，马邦德
Very clever!

1781
01:37:48,08 --> 01:37:48,87
你这个骗子
You goddamned crook!

1782
01:37:49,04 --> 01:37:50,87
早晚有一天你会被张麻子
One day Pocky will get you,

1783
01:37:51,04 --> 01:37:52,15
一枪崩了
and blast you to hell!

1784
01:37:52,32 --> 01:37:53,15
你崩了我？
You won't.

1785
01:37:53,32 --> 01:37:54,79
你舍不得
You love me too much.

1786
01:37:54,96 --> 01:37:57,71
你还真相信我就是张麻子？
You still think I'm "Pocky" Zhang?

1787
01:37:58,92 --> 01:38:01,03
你要不是张麻子，这山上可就有真麻子
If not, the real one must be somewhere around.

1788
01:39:21,08 --> 01:39:21,71
告诉他们
Tell them!

1789
01:39:21,88 --> 01:39:23,99
让老三去找老四，把南边干掉
Three joins Four to secure our south.

1790
01:39:24,12 --> 01:39:25,51
老七回来保护师爷！
Seven back to protect the Counselor.

1791
01:39:27,84 --> 01:39:30,79
“老三去找老四，干掉南面”
"Three and Four to secure the south."

1792
01:39:30,96 --> 01:39:34,39
“老七回来保护师爷”
"Seven back to guard the Counselor."

1793
01:39:45,88 --> 01:39:48,18
“我被包围了”
"I'm out-flanked."

1794
01:39:51,72 --> 01:39:52,67
“听我口令，甩斗笠”
"Throw the hats on my signal!"

1795
01:39:52,84 --> 01:39:54,91
“东边归我，西边归你”
"I'll take the east. You the west."

1796
01:40:11,72 --> 01:40:13,59
大哥，老三老四他们得手了
Three and Four are done.

1797
01:40:14,20 --> 01:40:15,91
大哥我到了！大哥我到了！
I'm back. I'm back.

1798
01:40:17,52 --> 01:40:18,31
师爷交给你了，快！
Stay with the Counselor!

1799
01:40:18,52 --> 01:40:19,39
明白！
Understood.

1800
01:40:19,72 --> 01:40:20,78
师爷，快！
Counselor, come!

1801
01:40:24,16 --> 01:40:25,07
三哥！
Three!

1802
01:40:26,52 --> 01:40:27,55
好像是二哥
It looks like Two.

1803
01:40:27,84 --> 01:40:30,35
南国张麻子在此
Pocky Zhang is here.

1804
01:40:31,84 --> 01:40:35,67
钱留下，银子也留下… 是二哥
- Leave your money... - It's Two.

1805
01:47:42,20 --> 01:47:44,66
老爷，散不了吧！
The money is not being taken!

1806
01:47:45,28 --> 01:47:49,75
你瞧，除了鹅，没有活物敢过去
No one dare to go near except those geese!

1807
01:47:59,28 --> 01:47:59,79
我去找花姐
I'll go and find Flora!

1808
01:47:59,96 --> 01:48:01,95
你把花姐和替身都给我找回来
Bring her and Huang's double back.

1809
01:48:02,12 --> 01:48:03,59
三天之内必须找回来！
We only have three days.

1810
01:48:03,76 --> 01:48:05,91
这个张麻子到底要干嘛呢？
What is on his mind?

1811
01:48:06,04 --> 01:48:07,55
他们干什么都是白干！
They're a bunch of clowns!

1812
01:49:19,88 --> 01:49:22,79
老爷，咱们放的是马，不是船
But we just sent horses, not straw boats.

1813
01:49:23,88 --> 01:49:24,63
你这个傻瓜
Idiot!

1814
01:49:24,80 --> 01:49:27,79
这叫比喻！比喻！…
It's only a metaphor!

1815
01:49:28,00 --> 01:49:29,31
不就是赤壁嘛！
You're almost metaphysical!

1816
01:49:51,32 --> 01:49:52,79
银子都被黄四郎收走了
Huang has taken all the silvers.

1817
01:49:53,60 --> 01:49:55,51
胜算都不到一成了
We've no chance of winning.

1818
01:49:57,04 --> 01:49:58,87
“六成”
"60%"

1819
01:49:59,04 --> 01:50:00,35
黄四郎都没出面啊
Huang didn't even have to show up,

1820
01:50:00,56 --> 01:50:02,35
老百姓把所有钱都交出去了
everyone has surrendered their money.

1821
01:50:02,56 --> 01:50:03,59
哪来六啊？
How can it be 60%?

1822
01:50:03,76 --> 01:50:04,82
说得对！
Well said!

1823
01:50:05,04 --> 01:50:05,67
为什么？
So why 60%?

1824
01:50:05,84 --> 01:50:06,75
怕啊！
It's because of fear.

1825
01:50:06,92 --> 01:50:08,27
怕里边有什么？
What lies beneath fear?

1826
01:50:08,96 --> 01:50:10,15
有怒！
Rage!

1827
01:50:10,80 --> 01:50:13,51
我一定把他们心里的怒给勾出来
We need to bring forth their rage!

1828
01:50:22,80 --> 01:50:24,19
满街枪弹在你手！
As guns and ammos wait for you,

1829
01:50:25,08 --> 01:50:27,15
十成白银在碉楼！
Huang hoards fortune in his citadel.

1830
01:50:28,28 --> 01:50:29,87
满街枪弹在你手！
As guns and ammos wait for you,

1831
01:50:31,16 --> 01:50:32,91
十成白银在碉楼！
Huang hoards fortune in his citadel.

1832
01:50:59,08 --> 01:51:00,99
屡败还屡战！
Never-say-die!

1833
01:51:01,20 --> 01:51:01,71
我喜欢！
I like that!

1834
01:51:01,88 --> 01:51:04,71
那是枪啊！要不，放马？
Those are guns! Send carriages?

1835
01:51:04,88 --> 01:51:09,39
拿银子，是贪！拿枪，是反
Money incites greed. But guns are seditious!

1836
01:51:09,88 --> 01:51:11,27
他们没这个胆！
They wouldn't dare.

1837
01:51:12,72 --> 01:51:15,15
银子被收走了，枪也没人拿
The money's gone, but the guns remain!

1838
01:51:15,80 --> 01:51:16,71
怎么办，大哥？
What do we do now?

1839
01:51:16,88 --> 01:51:18,15
胜算几成？
What are our chances?

1840
01:51:18,72 --> 01:51:20,23
“七成”
"70%"

1841
01:51:22,12 --> 01:51:23,91
黄四郎把所有的钱都给收了
Huang has taken all the money.

1842
01:51:24,08 --> 01:51:25,19
我们发的枪也没人拿
But no one takes our guns.

1843
01:51:25,36 --> 01:51:26,58
哪来的七成啊？
How come it's 70%?

1844
01:51:26,76 --> 01:51:29,55
黄四郎要是不收银子，我发枪干什么？
If he hadn't taken the money, I wouldn't have to distribute the guns!

1845
01:51:30,04 --> 01:51:32,67
黄四郎不收银子，我发枪干什么？
...wouldn't have distributed the guns!

1846
01:51:32,84 --> 01:51:33,95
我…
I...

1847
01:51:34,76 --> 01:51:35,90
去睡会儿
need a nap.

1848
01:51:48,32 --> 01:51:48,83
东风
King!

1849
01:51:49,00 --> 01:51:50,35
南风 胡了
- Queen! - Bingo!

1850
01:51:54,20 --> 01:51:55,11
我明白了
I got it!

1851
01:51:55,28 --> 01:51:57,66
你发的不是枪，你发的就是怒！
You were inciting rage and anger!

1852
01:51:58,08 --> 01:51:58,99
收枪
Collect the guns.

1853
01:52:13,76 --> 01:52:14,71
没动静啊
You missed?

1854
01:57:00,08 --> 01:57:02,07
要出人命了！
There will be fatalities!

1855
01:57:04,32 --> 01:57:05,83
至少得死一个
At least one of them will die!

1856
01:57:07,44 --> 01:57:08,35
起！
Hoist!

1857
01:57:09,92 --> 01:57:12,67
弟兄们，我们打赢了，凯旋
Brothers! We've won the war!

1858
01:57:12,92 --> 01:57:13,23
明白吗？
Understood?

1859
01:57:13,40 --> 01:57:14,03
明白！
Understood!

1860
01:38:40,08 --> 01:38:41,11
东边还有一大片！
Another group to the east.

1861
01:38:41,32 --> 01:38:42,51
让老七去找老三
Tell Seven to join Three!

1862
01:38:42,96 --> 01:38:44,02
先把西边的收拾掉
Secure our west flank.

1863
01:38:47,64 --> 01:38:52,27
“老七去找老三，干掉西面”
"Seven and Three to secure west flank!"

1864
01:38:57,64 --> 01:38:59,91
“我到了”
"I'm there!"

1865
01:39:00,60 --> 01:39:01,66
“不是十个，是十一个”
"There are 11 of them, not 10!"

1866
01:39:01,84 --> 01:39:04,99
“没事，你四，我七”
"No sweat, let's share them!"

1867
01:39:14,36 --> 01:39:15,23
“落停”
"Done!"

1868
01:39:15,40 --> 01:39:16,87
老三来信，西边搞定
Message from Three. West is secured.

1869
01:39:18,44 --> 01:39:20,90
这鸡叫成电台了，我看行！
These pheasant calls really work wonder!

1870
01:42:22,88 --> 01:42:24,10
假麻子抓到了
They caught the fake!

1871
01:42:25,36 --> 01:42:26,58
你是张麻子？
You're "Pocky" Zhang?

1872
01:42:27,00 --> 01:42:28,22
你脸上怎么没有麻子呢？
Where are your pockmarks?

1873
01:42:28,64 --> 01:42:29,51
这事谁问谁死！
No one asking that question has survived.

1874
01:42:29,68 --> 01:42:30,95
明白了！不问了
Oops! I take it back.

1875
01:42:32,52 --> 01:42:33,83
我这儿有一宝贝
I've got something special.

1876
01:42:34,16 --> 01:42:35,07
送给你了
You can have them,

1877
01:42:35,24 --> 01:42:36,67
能换我一条命吧？
in exchange for my life.

1878
01:42:39,84 --> 01:42:41,19
那…那两个人呢？
What happened to them?

1879
01:42:41,32 --> 01:42:43,15
说实话能换一条命吧
If I tell you, will you spare me?

1880
01:42:43,32 --> 01:42:43,75
快说！
Speak!

1881
01:42:43,92 --> 01:42:46,11
大个的被我给锯了， 比矮个的还矮
I sawed the legs off the tall one.

1882
01:42:46,28 --> 01:42:47,11
矮的呢？
And the short one?

1883
01:42:47,28 --> 01:42:48,19
当场就被吓死了
She died of fright at the sight!

1884
01:42:51,72 --> 01:42:52,19
师爷！
Counselor.

1885
01:42:52,32 --> 01:42:53,43
师爷！师爷！
Counselor...

1886
01:42:53,64 --> 01:42:54,55
谁让你冒充我的？
Who's behind this scam?

1887
01:42:54,72 --> 01:42:55,83
黄老爷
Master Huang.

1888
01:42:56,68 --> 01:42:57,74
麻子哪儿来的？
Nice pockmarks!

1889
01:42:57,92 --> 01:42:58,59
他烫的
He burnt them.

1890
01:42:58,76 --> 01:42:59,74
劫了几任县官？
How many governors have you robbed?

1891
01:42:59,92 --> 01:43:01,19
说出来能换条命吗？
Will you spare me?

1892
01:43:01,36 --> 01:43:01,95
快说！
Speak!

1893
01:43:02,12 --> 01:43:04,79
五回！五个县长全被我给干掉了
I've killed five governors,

1894
01:43:04,96 --> 01:43:06,23
钱我跟黄老爷给分了
and shared the loot with Master Huang.

1895
01:43:06,40 --> 01:43:07,43
那是什么？
What's that?

1896
01:43:07,64 --> 01:43:09,51
万民伞！那五个被我干掉的县长留下的
A governor's silver umbrella.

1897
01:43:09,68 --> 01:43:10,87
全都给你！
Take it!

1898
01:43:11,20 --> 01:43:12,99
山西往哪边走啊？ 我还有四把呢
- Which way to Shanxi? - I have four more.

1899
01:43:13,16 --> 01:43:14,38
我知道
I know the way.

1900
01:43:14,60 --> 01:43:15,71
说出来能换条人命吧？
Will you spare me if I tell you?

1901
01:43:15,88 --> 01:43:16,86
快他妈说！
Goddamned it! Speak!

1902
01:43:17,04 --> 01:43:18,75
往东！往东！
To the east, to the east!

1903
01:43:19,60 --> 01:43:22,63
哎呀！不能往东！千万不能往东！
Come back! You mustn't go that way!

1904
01:43:29,84 --> 01:43:31,87
山西确实是在东边
But Shanxi really is to our east.

1905
01:59:39,40 --> 01:59:41,35
一刀给砍了！
by that stupid Governor!

1906
01:59:41,72 --> 01:59:44,79
何止是愚蠢，简直就是愚蠢
That was stupid! That was ignorant!

1907
01:59:44,96 --> 01:59:45,87
这公平吗？
That's not justice!

1908
01:59:46,04 --> 01:59:46,87
不公平！
No! It's not!

1909
01:59:47,08 --> 01:59:48,19
乡亲们答应吗？
Can you let this pass?

1910
01:59:48,36 --> 01:59:49,34
不答应！
No!

1911
01:59:49,56 --> 01:59:50,35
我不是他
I am not him.

1912
01:59:50,56 --> 01:59:51,43
我知道你是替身
I know you're his double.

1913
01:59:51,64 --> 01:59:53,35
替他享福！替他作恶！
But you shared his life and committed his crimes.

1914
01:59:53,56 --> 01:59:56,19
你就应该替他，把他没受过的罪
So you should be punished

1915
01:59:56,36 --> 01:59:57,27
给我受够了！
as if you were him!

1916
01:59:57,44 --> 01:59:58,71
跪下！ 我真的不是他
- Kneel down! - I really am not him!

1917
01:59:58,88 --> 02:00:00,63
跪下！跪下！…
Kneel down! Kneel!

1918
02:00:00,80 --> 02:00:01,78
别让我发脾气
Don't make me mad!

1919
02:00:01,96 --> 02:00:02,59
我数三下！
On my count of three!

1920
02:00:02,76 --> 02:00:03,67
一！
One!

1921
02:00:05,28 --> 02:00:06,34
二！
Two!

1922
02:00:07,08 --> 02:00:07,87
一！
One!

1923
02:00:08,24 --> 02:00:09,15
二！
Two!

1924
02:00:09,32 --> 02:00:11,51
谁？哪个欠打的？
What the...? Who's the son-of-a-bitch?

1925
02:00:11,68 --> 02:00:13,31
又想挨板子了是吧？
Want your ass kicked again?

1926
02:00:13,52 --> 02:00:15,03
大人，我讨厌吗？
Am I bothering you, sir?

1927
02:00:15,20 --> 02:00:17,15
如果我讨厌，我立马消失！
Say the word and I'll disappear.

1928
02:00:17,32 --> 02:00:19,75
如果不讨厌，我继续欺负他！
If not, I'll just carry on.

1929
02:00:20,76 --> 02:00:21,90
很讨厌
Go away.

1930
02:00:22,12 --> 02:00:23,91
大人，兄弟我就走了！
Right, we're going.

1931
02:00:24,08 --> 02:00:25,87
需要兄弟的时候，你吐喝一声
Just yell if you need me.

1932
02:00:26,04 --> 02:00:27,15
兄弟立马出现
Always at your service, sir.

1933
02:00:27,32 --> 02:00:30,15
告辞！告辞！走！
Goodbye, sir. Beat it!

1934
02:00:42,64 --> 02:00:43,95
下一步有什么打算？
What's next for you?

1935
02:00:44,12 --> 02:00:46,55
留在鹅城代替我？
Take my place here?

1936
02:00:48,92 --> 02:00:50,14
我不是家禽
I'm not a caged bird.

1937
02:00:51,40 --> 02:00:52,71
你是野兽
You're a predator.

1938
02:00:58,96 --> 02:01:02,35
进城那天，如果我亲自去接你
The day of your inauguration,

1939
02:01:02,64 --> 02:01:05,87
不是叫胡万过去给你捣乱
had I greeted you in person,

1940
01:45:51,88 --> 01:45:54,99
我弄不清楚你到底是老汤
I can't quite figure you out.

1941
01:45:55,80 --> 01:45:57,31
还是马邦德？
Counselor Tang or Governor Ma?

1942
01:45:58,24 --> 01:46:00,23
但是你没了
Now that you're gone,

1943
01:46:01,52 --> 01:46:03,35
张麻子也没了
"Pocky" Zhang, too, is no more.

1944
01:46:03,68 --> 01:46:07,63
真的也没了，假的也没了
Fact or fiction no longer matter now.

1945
01:46:08,84 --> 01:46:14,75
兄弟，我要帮你把这个县长当下去
For you, I'll go back and finish this war!

1946
01:46:16,04 --> 01:46:17,39
弟兄们
Brothers!

1947
01:46:18,16 --> 01:46:19,35
回鹅城！
March on Goose Town!

1948
01:46:24,00 --> 01:46:25,43
这个张麻子
This "Pocky" Zhang

1949
01:46:26,84 --> 01:46:28,91
杀了假麻子
has killed his imposter.

1950
01:46:29,84 --> 01:46:32,03
得了钱，不逃命
But instead of fleeing with the money,

1951
01:46:32,52 --> 01:46:35,08
莫非要跟我鱼死网破？
he wants a showdown with me.

1952
01:46:35,24 --> 01:46:37,07
那就请官兵来剿匪！
Let's get reinforcement.

1953
01:46:37,24 --> 01:46:38,95
我早就派胡百过去了
I've sent Hu Bai to fetch troops.

1954
01:46:39,12 --> 01:46:42,66
三天之后郭旅长的骑兵就到了
Cavalry will arrive in 3 days.

1955
01:46:45,60 --> 01:46:47,75
县长要斩黄四郎！
Governor swears to behead Huang,

1956
01:46:51,76 --> 01:46:54,22
谁人不想斩黄郎！
public enemy number one.

1957
01:46:57,00 --> 01:46:59,43
拐卖壮丁贩烟土！
Trades in opium and human misery,

1958
01:47:02,96 --> 01:47:05,59
杀了五任好县长！
Huang has killed five governors.

1959
01:47:09,12 --> 01:47:11,55
一成白银送你手！
The money that's been given out,

1960
01:47:15,04 --> 01:47:17,63
九成真金黄家藏！
is but one-tenth of his hoard!

1961
01:47:21,20 --> 01:47:23,50
邦德发誓三天内！
In memory of his dead comrades,

1962
01:47:26,96 --> 01:47:31,75
除暴安良祭老汤！
Ma will parade Huang's head in 3 days!

1963
01:47:37,28 --> 01:47:39,71
白花花的银子都散给了穷人
He gave away all his money to the poor.

1964
01:47:39,88 --> 01:47:41,07
作孽！
Disgraceful!

1965
01:52:15,24 --> 01:52:16,55
让子弹飞一会儿！
Let the bullets fly!

1966
01:52:21,24 --> 01:52:22,11
枪响了
Shots were fired!

1967
01:52:22,28 --> 01:52:23,50
看！
Look!

1968
01:52:27,04 --> 01:52:29,03
怒了，全都怒了！
They're all raging mad!

1969
01:52:31,92 --> 01:52:35,03
他妈的的刁民，敢杀我的马？
How dare they shot my horse?

1970
01:53:03,76 --> 01:53:05,87
枪在手，跟我走！
Those with guns follow me.

1971
01:53:06,04 --> 01:53:18,11
杀四郎，抢碉楼！
Kill Huang and storm his citadel...

1972
01:53:20,20 --> 01:53:22,07
枪在手，跟我走！
Those with guns follow me.

1973
01:53:22,24 --> 01:53:29,11
杀四郎，抢碉楼！
Kill Huang and storm his citadel...

1974
01:53:30,92 --> 01:53:32,63
枪在手，跟我走！
Those with guns follow me.

1975
01:53:32,80 --> 01:53:37,71
杀四郎，抢碉楼！
Kill Huang and storm his citadel...

1976
01:54:11,72 --> 01:54:22,83
杀四郎，抢碉楼！
Kill Huang and storm his citadel...

1977
01:54:30,60 --> 01:54:31,66
大哥，大哥你看
Chief, look.

1978
01:54:31,84 --> 01:54:33,51
跟我们来的只有它们！
Only they have come this far with us!

1979
01:54:34,28 --> 01:54:36,19
高兴早了，没人帮咱们！
We're on our own!

1980
01:54:37,28 --> 01:54:38,50
明白了！
I see.

1981
01:54:38,68 --> 01:54:40,27
谁赢，他们帮谁！
They will only side with the victors.

1982
01:54:40,52 --> 01:54:43,23
黄四郎四百人，我们四个人，怎么赢啊？
We can't overcome Huang's 400 men!

1983
01:54:43,44 --> 01:54:44,79
打！打就能赢！
Shoot! We can win!

1984
01:54:44,96 --> 01:54:46,23
打哪儿？这只有铁门
What's our target? There's only a gate.

1985
01:54:46,44 --> 01:54:47,71
就打铁门！
Let's blast the gate, then.

1986
01:54:53,68 --> 01:54:55,07
他们鼓动了多少人？
How many people have they brought?

1987
01:54:55,20 --> 01:54:56,07
就他们四个
Just the four of them.

1988
01:54:56,20 --> 01:54:56,79
不可能吧！
You're kidding!

1989
01:54:56,96 --> 01:54:57,83
还有…
and also...

1990
01:54:58,00 --> 01:54:59,51
五十只鹅
fifty geese.

1991
01:54:59,68 --> 01:55:01,55
打！打够！
Great! Let them shoot!

1992
01:55:02,08 --> 01:55:03,75
让他打个够！
Let them goddamned shoot!

1993
01:55:22,00 --> 01:55:23,75
大哥，天快亮了
It's almost day break.

1994
01:55:23,92 --> 01:55:25,43
三哥不回来可就…
If Three doesn't return in time...

1995
01:55:27,56 --> 01:55:29,15
我知道你是怎么想的
I know what's on your mind.

1996
01:55:29,40 --> 01:55:30,51
知道惊叹号吧
Can you draw an exclamation mark?

1997
01:55:31,60 --> 01:55:33,35
在门上打出个惊叹号来
Let's do one on the gate!

1998
01:55:33,56 --> 01:55:34,62
好日勒
Right on.

1999
01:55:37,08 --> 01:55:39,79
这像惊叹号吗？那点呢？
What's that? Where's the dot?

2000
01:55:41,36 --> 01:55:42,19
歪了
You missed!

2001
01:55:43,04 --> 01:55:43,75
躲开
Move over.

2002
01:55:47,00 --> 01:55:48,03
勾？
A hook stroke?

2003
01:55:49,20 --> 01:55:50,03
再看
Look again!

2004
01:55:51,60 --> 01:55:52,58
问号
A question mark!

2005
02:01:33,64 --> 02:01:39,63
可是六子，老二，师爷、夫人
But Six, Two, Counselor and his wife...

2006
02:01:40,08 --> 02:01:42,11
我听不到他们的声音了
I can no longer hear their voice.

2007
02:01:42,44 --> 02:01:45,55
而且永远听不到了
Never ever again.

2008
02:01:47,32 --> 02:01:48,95
你们四个人
Their four lives,

2009
02:01:49,80 --> 02:01:51,83
换我五代家业
in exchange for my heirloom,

2010
02:01:52,64 --> 02:01:53,43
不合算吗？
isn't that enough?

2011
02:01:53,64 --> 02:01:55,59
怎么算帐那是你的事
That's none of my business.

2012
02:01:55,92 --> 02:01:56,90
对我来说…
To me,

2013
02:01:57,44 --> 02:01:59,87
钱是钱，人是人
they are separate issues.

2014
02:02:00,28 --> 02:02:02,63
钱归了你，我认了
You could have kept the money.

2015
02:02:04,08 --> 02:02:05,91
为什么要散给他们？
But why did you give it away?

2016
02:02:07,68 --> 02:02:10,19
黄老爷，我问你个问题
Master Huang, let me ask you a question.

2017
02:02:10,52 --> 02:02:11,39
说
Shoot!

2018
02:02:12,12 --> 02:02:14,19
你说是钱对我重要
Which is more important to me?

2019
02:02:14,40 --> 02:02:15,67
还是你对我重要？
You or your fortune?

2020
02:02:16,84 --> 02:02:17,98
我
Me.

2021
02:02:19,68 --> 02:02:20,82
再想想
Think again.

2022
02:02:23,88 --> 02:02:25,27
不会是钱吧？
Can it be the money?

2023
02:02:26,36 --> 02:02:27,71
再想想
Think again.

2024
02:02:32,60 --> 02:02:33,95
还是我重要
I still think it's me.

2025
02:02:34,12 --> 02:02:37,27
你和钱对我都不重要
Neither matters to me.

2026
02:02:39,04 --> 02:02:40,18
那谁重要？
Then what is?

2027
02:02:44,20 --> 02:02:47,31
没有你，对我很重要
To rid of you is more important.

2028
02:02:57,88 --> 02:02:59,27
你不是找火柴吧？
Looking for a light?

2029
02:02:59,68 --> 02:03:00,35
不是
No.

2030
02:03:00,56 --> 02:03:02,03
那…
You must be...

2031
02:03:02,96 --> 02:03:04,31
你是找这个
Iooking for this.

2032
02:03:12,40 --> 02:03:13,59
你是个体面人
You're a man of honour.

2033
02:03:21,20 --> 02:03:22,42
只有一颗子弹
There's only one bullet left.

2034
02:03:24,12 --> 02:03:25,23
够
That's enough.

2035
02:03:25,92 --> 02:03:27,11
等等
Wait.

2036
02:03:27,64 --> 02:03:28,91
有话要我带给老汤？
Any message for Tang?

2037
02:03:29,08 --> 02:03:30,87
对了，告诉他…
Right, tell him...

2038
02:03:32,16 --> 02:03:33,51
我对不起他
I owe him an apology.

2039
02:03:34,16 --> 02:03:35,11
我骗了他
I lied to him.

2040
02:03:36,36 --> 02:03:37,75
你骗了他什么？
What was your lie?

2041
02:03:38,00 --> 02:03:40,30
我跟他说不回鹅城了
I said I wouldn't come back.

2042
02:03:40,76 --> 02:03:41,71
可是我回来了
But here I am.

2043
02:03:42,24 --> 02:03:43,22
你…
You...

2044
02:03:43,40 --> 02:03:44,95
你应该说到做到
You should have kept your promise.

2045
02:03:45,12 --> 02:03:46,95
是，我对不起他
Yes, I let him down.

2046
02:03:48,76 --> 02:03:50,15
可是我对你
But when it comes to you,

2047
02:03:50,92 --> 02:03:52,63
就要说到做到
I'll definitely keep my words.

2048
02:03:57,52 --> 02:03:58,71
明白
Understood.

2049
02:04:00,16 --> 02:04:01,75
明白！
Understood...

2050
02:04:10,88 --> 02:04:12,23
县长，县长…
Governor...

2051
02:04:12,84 --> 02:04:14,31
这两把椅子归我了
These chairs are mine.

2052
02:04:21,04 --> 02:04:22,95
大哥…
Chief...

2053
02:04:26,64 --> 02:04:27,67
别慌
Easy...

2054
02:04:28,08 --> 02:04:28,75
我能问你个问题吗？
Can I ask you a question?

2055
02:04:28,96 --> 02:04:29,87
说
Sure.

2056
02:04:31,28 --> 02:04:33,19
你喜欢花姐对吗？
You fancy Flora, right?

2057
02:04:34,12 --> 02:04:35,67
县长，县长
Governor,

2058
02:04:35,84 --> 02:04:37,71
我觉得我可以出现了
may I interrupt?

2059
02:04:38,04 --> 02:04:39,43
刚才我都听见了
I overheard everything.

2060
02:04:39,72 --> 02:04:41,67
他可不是个体面的人
Huang is not an honourable man.

2061
02:08:19,44 --> 02:08:21,39
上海就是浦东！
Shanghai is Pudong!

2062
02:08:21,88 --> 02:08:24,55
浦东就是上海！
Pudong is Shanghai!

2063
01:55:53,72 --> 01:55:56,15
小子，你只要打得准
If you can shoot straight,

2064
01:55:56,32 --> 01:55:57,59
什么时候都能跑！
you'll have nothing to worry!

2065
01:55:58,24 --> 01:55:58,99
把你们的子弹
Empty your guns

2066
01:55:59,16 --> 01:56:00,59
从那问号的点里打过去
at the question mark!

2067
01:56:00,76 --> 01:56:02,03
好啦！快！
Okay!

2068
01:56:04,16 --> 01:56:05,95
大哥…！
Chief, chief...

2069
01:56:09,32 --> 01:56:10,35
说，说话
Speak up!

2070
01:56:10,56 --> 01:56:11,35
我回来了
I'm back!

2071
01:56:11,56 --> 01:56:12,19
三天整！
Three days,

2072
01:56:12,36 --> 01:56:12,99
就这事
one mission!

2073
01:56:13,52 --> 01:56:14,19
人呢？
Where are they?

2074
01:56:14,20 --> 01:56:15,18
都在那
They're here.

2075
01:56:16,96 --> 01:56:17,94
你可回来了！
You're back, at last.

2076
01:56:18,12 --> 01:56:20,27
我不是他，我只是个唱戏的！
I'm not Huang! I'm just an actor!

2077
01:56:20,44 --> 01:56:21,23
怎么回事？
What happened?

2078
01:56:21,40 --> 01:56:23,43
他跑我就追，他跑我就追
He ran away and I chased after him.

2079
01:56:23,64 --> 01:56:24,39
就越跑越远了！
We ran a long way!

2080
01:56:24,60 --> 01:56:25,51
他跑我就堵
I caught up with them.

2081
01:56:25,68 --> 01:56:27,87
他跑我就堵，就给堵回来了！
He finally succumbed after I'd him cornered.

2082
01:56:29,72 --> 01:56:30,31
就这么简单？
That was it?

2083
01:56:30,52 --> 01:56:31,83
对，就这么简单
Yes, that simple.

2084
01:56:32,00 --> 01:56:32,79
弟兄们
Brothers!

2085
01:56:33,44 --> 01:56:34,63
为了庆贺三哥回来
To mark Three's return,

2086
01:56:34,80 --> 01:56:36,27
把所有的子弹都打出去
Iet's go and empty our guns!

2087
01:56:36,44 --> 01:56:37,75
好！ 走！
- Right. - Let's go!

2088
01:56:37,92 --> 01:56:39,27
那我呢？
What about me?

2089
01:56:39,44 --> 01:56:40,39
趴下！
Squat!

2090
01:56:55,56 --> 01:56:56,67
就他们四个人？
Just four of them?

2091
01:59:25,80 --> 01:59:26,43
留不留啊？
Let him go?

2092
01:59:26,64 --> 01:59:29,63
欠打的过来！过去！…
You bastard, go over here! Over there!

2093
01:59:29,80 --> 01:59:30,35
站好了！
Stand properly!

2094
01:59:30,56 --> 01:59:31,78
乡亲们！
My fellow townsfolk!

2095
01:59:31,96 --> 01:59:33,63
黄四郎是死了
Huang has died!

2096
01:59:33,84 --> 01:59:35,67
但死得太便宜了
But he has got off lightly!

2097
01:59:35,88 --> 01:59:37,07
咔嚓呀
Swoosh!

2098
01:59:37,24 --> 01:59:39,23
被那个愚蠢县长
He was fell in one blow

2099
02:04:42,12 --> 02:04:43,55
我给了他一把手枪
I gave him a pistol.

2100
02:04:44,28 --> 02:04:46,27
他要是体面，你就让他体面
He can take his own life.

2101
02:04:46,64 --> 02:04:49,10
他要是不体面，你就帮他体面
If he doesn't, lend him a hand.

2102
02:04:49,28 --> 02:04:50,23
我明白！
Understood.

2103
02:04:50,40 --> 02:04:51,99
我有九种办法弄死他！
I have 9 ways to skin this cat!

2104
02:04:52,16 --> 02:04:53,35
九种！
Nine ways!

2105
02:04:54,96 --> 02:04:56,23
听我的雷声！
You'll hear my roar!

2106
02:04:57,12 --> 02:04:59,03
是有这么回事，怎么了？
Maybe just a little. Why?

2107
02:05:03,72 --> 02:05:05,11
千万别说是我说的
Don't say I tipped you off.

2108
02:05:09,80 --> 02:05:12,07
大哥，我们准备去上海了
Chief, we're off to Shanghai.

2109
02:05:12,32 --> 02:05:13,63
不跟我回山里了？
Not riding back with me?

2110
01:57:14,20 --> 01:57:14,79
说一遍！
Say it out loud!

2111
01:57:14,96 --> 01:57:16,71
赢了！凯旋！
Yes, victory.

2112
01:57:16,92 --> 01:57:17,90
招摇过市！
Let's parade him.

2113
01:57:18,44 --> 01:57:19,35
跟我走！
Follow me.

2114
01:57:27,20 --> 01:57:29,07
黄四郎被抓了！
Huang's been captured.

2115
01:57:29,72 --> 01:57:31,79
黄四郎被抓了！
Huang's been captured!

2116
01:57:32,80 --> 01:57:36,55
黄四郎被抓了！
Huang's been captured.

2117
01:57:51,00 --> 01:57:55,23
杀！
Kill!

2118
01:58:05,52 --> 01:58:06,95
糟了，糟了！
Shit, we're in trouble!

2119
01:58:07,80 --> 01:58:09,07
我成替身了
I've died as my double!

2120
01:58:09,24 --> 01:58:12,07
去碉楼，拿回你们自己的东西
Reclaim what's yours from the citadel!

2121
01:58:19,64 --> 01:58:21,07
跟我来！
Come with me!

2122
01:58:23,64 --> 01:58:24,55
杀！
Charge!

2123
01:58:39,20 --> 01:58:42,43
杀…！
Charge!

2124
01:58:49,32 --> 01:58:50,75
跟我来！
Follow me!

2125
01:59:12,84 --> 01:59:13,95
碉楼打进去了？
The citadel's been breached?

2126
01:59:14,12 --> 01:59:14,99
对！
Yes!

2127
01:59:15,16 --> 01:59:16,59
黄四郎被抓住了
Huang's been captured!

2128
01:59:16,76 --> 01:59:18,15
对！
Yes!

2129
01:59:18,76 --> 01:59:20,87
正被当成替身，挨揍呢
They took him for his double.

2130
01:59:21,08 --> 01:59:22,99
黄四郎的威风是被你砍了
You've ended Huang's reign.

2131
01:59:23,92 --> 01:59:25,35
他这肉身怎么办啊？
What do we do with him now?

2132
02:01:07,04 --> 02:01:08,91
结果会不会不一样？
would things have turned out differently?

2133
02:01:09,16 --> 02:01:11,79
那帽子挺好，我喜欢
It was a nice hat. I liked it.

2134
02:01:12,04 --> 02:01:15,11
那不是最好的，我家里还有更好的
I have nicer ones at home.

2135
02:01:16,16 --> 02:01:17,27
转头送给你
I can give them to you.

2136
02:01:20,40 --> 02:01:22,15
一下子弄成了这样
Everything's gone in a flash.

2137
02:01:23,96 --> 02:01:25,99
你让我输得很惨啊！
You've totally wiped me out.

2138
02:01:27,80 --> 02:01:29,59
惨吗？黄老爷
It's not that bad.

2139
02:01:29,76 --> 02:01:31,31
你现在还抽着烟
You're still having a smoke,

2140
02:01:31,88 --> 02:01:33,43
还说着话
still chit-chatting.

2141
02:05:13,80 --> 02:05:14,86
还想回山里啊？
Still want to resume banditry?

2142
02:05:15,04 --> 02:05:16,59
您这腿脚都不利落了
You're too old for this.

2143
02:05:17,24 --> 02:05:19,67
怎么也不跟我打个招呼
You should've given me a heads-up.

2144
02:05:20,16 --> 02:05:21,87
这不正要跟您打招呼了嘛
That's what we're doing!

2145
02:05:22,92 --> 02:05:25,27
你不是要跟我当麻匪，到处发钱吗？
Didn't you want to be one of us?

2146
02:05:25,44 --> 02:05:27,11
今天不是把钱都发光了吗？
I just helped to dish out the money.

2147
02:05:27,28 --> 02:05:28,83
还有比今天更过瘾的？
I've never had a more satisfying day!

2148
02:05:29,08 --> 02:05:30,55
你看我都穿上这身了！
I'm even dressed for the part!

2149
02:05:31,72 --> 02:05:32,83
这么说…
So...

2150
02:05:34,04 --> 02:05:34,91
你改主意了？
you've changed your mind?

2151
02:05:35,08 --> 02:05:36,51
那还用说吗
That goes without saying!

2152
02:05:38,92 --> 02:05:40,95
老三，你有什么打算？
What's your plan, Three?

2153
02:05:41,96 --> 02:05:43,71
我要替二哥娶她
I'm going to marry her, on behalf of Two.

2154
02:05:45,84 --> 02:05:48,14
老二啊老二…
Two...

2155
02:05:48,92 --> 02:05:51,51
大哥，我是老三
Chief, I'm Three!

2156
02:05:54,56 --> 02:05:56,91
老三，你跟我在一起
Three, it no longer thrills you

2157
02:05:58,16 --> 02:06:00,11
不高兴吗？ 高兴
- to ride with me? - Yes!

2158
02:06:00,64 --> 02:06:01,75
就是…
But...

2159
02:06:02,60 --> 02:06:03,87
有点不轻松
it's been hard going lately.

2160
02:06:05,72 --> 02:06:06,78
你们俩呢？ 有点
- What about you? - We've had...

2161
02:06:06,96 --> 02:06:08,35
不轻松
better days.

2162
02:06:08,76 --> 02:06:09,59
老七呢？
Seven?

2163
02:06:14,08 --> 02:06:16,03
大哥…
Chief...

2164
02:06:17,56 --> 02:06:18,87
姑娘
Flora,

2165
02:06:19,88 --> 02:06:21,35
你这么拿着枪
hold your guns like this,

2166
02:06:21,96 --> 02:06:23,15
更好看
makes you look even cooler.

2167
02:06:28,76 --> 02:06:29,87
送你了
They're yours.

2168
02:06:32,52 --> 02:06:34,11
大哥，那我们先走一步啊！
Chief, we've got to go.

2169
02:06:34,28 --> 02:06:34,83
走了，大哥
Goodbye, Chief.

2170
02:06:35,00 --> 02:06:35,39
走！
Go!

2171
02:06:35,60 --> 02:06:37,31
走了，大哥
Bye, Chief!

2172
02:06:37,52 --> 02:06:39,63
别忘了下回跟我打个招呼啊
Give me a heads-up next time.

2173
00:34:47,12 --> 00:34:49,71
易守难攻，万夫莫开！
It is simply impregnable.

2174
00:34:50,12 --> 00:34:53,15
县长英雄气概，师爷文采斐然
An intrepid governor, an erudite counselor.

2175
00:34:53,32 --> 00:34:55,59
珠联璧合！二位请！
What a dream team!

2176
00:34:59,04 --> 00:35:01,71
六爷的死，壮烈！
Master Six has died heroically.

2177
00:35:02,20 --> 00:35:04,07
今天请县长来
I've invited you here today

2178
00:35:04,24 --> 00:35:08,59
就是要当面为六爷讨回这个公道！
to witness how justice is done.

2179
00:35:08,80 --> 00:35:10,63
如果真的是黄某指使
If I'm proven to be the instigator,

2180
00:35:10,80 --> 00:35:12,02
那我就像六爷一样
I will follow Master Six's footstep,

2181
00:35:12,20 --> 00:35:14,03
当众剖腹自杀！
and disembowel myself!

2182
00:35:14,20 --> 00:35:16,95
不但自杀，还请县长您
I invite you to be my second,

2183
00:37:14,88 --> 00:37:17,75
老大往往是空架子
It is hard to be a boss.

2184
00:37:18,04 --> 00:37:21,51
每天眼一睁，几百人吃、喝、拉、撒
Hundreds of people everyday

2185
00:37:21,68 --> 00:37:23,15
都要等着我伺候
waiting to be fed.

2186
00:37:23,32 --> 00:37:25,67
真正落到我嘴里的，能有几口
There is little left for me.

2187
00:37:25,84 --> 00:37:29,51
如果县长真的急着赚钱
If you're looking to make a fast buck,

2188
00:37:29,68 --> 00:37:31,83
我倒是有个好去处！
I know exactly what to do.

2189
00:37:32,64 --> 00:37:34,07
哦？请讲！
Please tell.

2190
00:37:34,96 --> 00:37:37,52
张麻子
Pocky Zhang!

2191
00:37:44,20 --> 00:37:45,55
真死了！
One of them just died!

2192
00:38:00,20 --> 00:38:01,55
张麻子？
Pocky Zhang?

2193
00:38:01,72 --> 00:38:03,87
对，张麻子！
Yes, Pocky Zhang!

2194
00:38:04,08 --> 00:38:07,91
那么这个张麻子，是跟我们有关系呢？
What has he got to do with us?

2195
00:38:08,08 --> 00:38:09,99
还是跟钱有关系？
Or with our money?

2196
00:38:10,16 --> 00:38:11,14
都有关系！
Everything!

2197
00:38:11,32 --> 00:38:13,35
莫非他在鹅城？
Is he here in Goose Town?

2198
00:38:13,56 --> 00:38:14,70
在…
Well, yes...

2199
00:38:16,64 --> 00:38:18,03
也不在！
and no!

2200
00:38:23,28 --> 00:38:26,31
黄老爷这话，还挺有玄机啊！
Master Huang speaks in riddles!

2201
00:29:43,04 --> 00:29:46,27
六爷，挺住！我去给你请大夫！
Hang in there! I'll get a doctor!

2202
00:29:47,16 --> 00:29:50,59
别走！是不是只有一碗！
There's only one bowl, right?

2203
00:29:50,80 --> 00:29:53,91
是不是只有一碗！是不是！
There's only one bowl, right?

2204
00:30:00,92 --> 00:30:02,14
该你了
Your turn!

2205
00:30:02,60 --> 00:30:04,51
我知道你只吃了一碗
I knew it all along.

2206
00:30:05,40 --> 00:30:07,15
你上当了
You fell for it.

2207
00:30:07,92 --> 00:30:11,67
不能杀…！我不能放！
You mustn't kill him! No, I won't!

2208
00:30:12,08 --> 00:30:12,95
为什么不能杀？
Tell me why I should spare him,

2209
00:30:13,12 --> 00:30:14,75
说不出说法来，我把你一起杀了
or I'll shoot you, too.

2210
00:23:05,20 --> 00:23:05,83
我
No, it's "me"!

2211
00:23:06,00 --> 00:23:06,63
你？
You?

2212
00:23:06,80 --> 00:23:08,63
你，你自己
You, you yourself!

2213
00:23:08,80 --> 00:23:10,71
我自己，我自己
Yes, me and me alone.

2214
00:23:10,88 --> 00:23:12,02
听不见
I can't hear you.

2215
00:26:02,64 --> 00:26:03,70
只给了一碗的钱
and paid only for one.

2216
00:26:03,88 --> 00:26:05,39
放屁，我就吃了一碗的粉
Bullshit! I have only eaten one bowl!

2217
00:26:05,60 --> 00:26:06,99
给了他一碗的钱！
And I paid him for one.

2218
00:26:07,16 --> 00:26:08,11
他吃了几碗？
How many bowls did he eat?

2219
00:26:08,28 --> 00:26:09,19
两碗
Two...

2220
00:26:09,36 --> 00:26:10,50
不可能！
No way!

2221
00:26:10,68 --> 00:26:12,19
六爷是县长的儿子
Master Six is the Governor's godson,

2222
00:26:12,36 --> 00:26:14,07
怎么能欠你的粉钱呢？
why would he want to cheat you?

2223
00:26:14,24 --> 00:26:16,15
就是吃了两碗，只给了一碗的钱
But he ate two bowls and paid for one.

2224
00:26:16,36 --> 00:26:20,83
县长要给我们鹅城一个公平
The Governor brings justice to our town.

2225
00:26:21,00 --> 00:26:22,11
好！
Good!

2226
00:26:22,28 --> 00:26:24,35
我今天讨的就是一个公平
And justice is what I seek today!

2227
00:26:24,56 --> 00:26:25,15
对
Hear hear!

2228
00:26:25,36 --> 00:26:28,75
问谁讨？问县长儿子。为什么？
From the Governor's son, of course.

2229
00:26:28,92 --> 00:26:32,11
他吃了两碗粉，只给了一碗的钱
Ate two bowls, paid for one!

2230
00:26:32,28 --> 00:26:34,23
这就叫作不公平！
That's so wrong!

2231
00:26:34,40 --> 00:26:36,55
既然县长儿子带头不公平
Since his boy is guilty of unjust,

2232
00:26:36,72 --> 00:26:38,31
那县长说的话就是个屁
the Governor's crusade is bullshit!

2233
00:26:38,52 --> 00:26:39,19
我操
Screw you!

2234
00:26:39,36 --> 00:26:42,98
六爷…
Master Six...

2235
00:26:43,76 --> 00:26:46,35
胡万，六爷是县长的儿子
Master Six is the Governor's godson!

2236
00:26:46,56 --> 00:26:47,95
怎么会欠他的粉钱呢？
Would he cheat over a bowl of jelly?

2237
00:26:48,12 --> 00:26:49,91
你亲眼看见了？
Did you see it with your own eyes?

2238
00:26:50,08 --> 00:26:53,39
嘿，你个吃里爬外的东西
You double-crosser!

2239
00:26:53,56 --> 00:26:54,75
怎么着？
What's wrong with you?

2240
00:26:55,00 --> 00:26:56,19
屁股不疼了？
You're thinking with your butts?

2241
00:26:57,04 --> 00:26:59,03
今不聊屁股的事
It's not about my butts.

2242
00:26:59,32 --> 00:27:00,63
就聊凉粉
We're here for the truth!

2243
00:27:00,80 --> 00:27:03,39
一碗就是一碗，两碗就是两碗
One or two bowls?

2244
00:27:03,56 --> 00:27:04,62
不能含糊
No beating about the bush!

2245
00:27:04,80 --> 00:27:07,39
六爷，汉子！佩服！
I admire your courage, sir.

2246
00:27:10,92 --> 00:27:12,79
一就是一，二就是二
I know how to count!

2247
00:27:12,96 --> 00:27:14,07
我今天就吃了一碗凉粉
I ate only one bowl!

2248
00:27:14,24 --> 00:27:16,75
你给了一碗的钱，吃了两碗粉
You ate two and paid for one.

2249
00:27:16,92 --> 00:27:19,75
你没钱是吧，我帮你给！
If you can't afford it, my treat!

2250
00:27:21,08 --> 00:27:23,07
看见了吗？多少碗我都付得起！
I can afford all the jelly in this world!

2251
00:27:23,24 --> 00:27:25,51
但是吃一碗的粉，就给一碗的钱
But I pay only for what I ate.

2252
00:27:25,68 --> 00:27:28,95
这么多钱，他吃了多少碗粉啊
How many bowls did he eat?

2253
00:36:07,68 --> 00:36:10,06
马某人这个县长，买来的
I bought this governorship.

2254
00:36:10,24 --> 00:36:11,75
买官就是为了赚钱
Sole purpose is to get rich.

2255
00:36:11,92 --> 00:36:15,39
而且，马某人不喜欢赚穷人的钱
But I don't take from the poor.

2256
00:36:15,60 --> 00:36:17,27
那你想赚谁的钱呢？
Then who are you targeting?

2257
00:36:17,44 --> 00:36:19,35
谁有钱就赚谁的！
Only the wealthy people.

2258
00:36:19,56 --> 00:36:20,31
那谁有钱？
Who are the wealthy?

2259
00:36:20,52 --> 00:36:21,79
你有钱
Such as you.

2260
00:36:23,04 --> 00:36:27,43
爽快！县长看上什么了，随便拿
Whatever you fancy, help yourself.

2261
00:36:31,88 --> 00:36:34,03
我不是土匪！我是县长
I'm no bandit. I'm a governor.

2262
00:36:34,20 --> 00:36:37,95
县长赚钱得讲究个名正言顺才是
I make my fortune the proper way.

2263
00:36:38,12 --> 00:36:38,87
说得好
Well said!

2264
00:36:39,24 --> 00:36:40,99
我们鹅城有两大家族
Goose Town has two big families.

2265
00:36:41,16 --> 00:36:44,07
都是把人卖到美国修铁路
They sell people to America to build railroads,

2266
00:36:44,24 --> 00:36:46,80
赚的都是美金
in return for dollars!

2267
00:36:46,96 --> 00:36:48,35
还说刀的事
What do you mean by dolls?

2268
00:36:48,56 --> 00:36:52,18
不是…美金是美国人用的钱
No, d-o-l-l-a-r-s! American money.

2269
00:36:52,36 --> 00:36:53,42
美金！懂吗？
Dollar! You know?

2270
00:36:53,64 --> 00:36:54,99
美金，收到了
Oh, dollars!

2271
00:36:55,16 --> 00:36:58,91
黄老爷一来，钱就到了
I can smell it in your presence!

2272
00:37:01,08 --> 00:37:02,30
喝一杯吧 好，来
- Let's drink to that! - Great, cheers!

2273
00:37:02,52 --> 00:37:03,87
来…
Cheers!

2274
00:37:06,16 --> 00:37:08,99
黄老爷，客气了
Master Huang is so modest.

2275
00:37:09,16 --> 00:37:11,23
整个南国谁不知道
It is an open secret that,

2276
00:37:11,52 --> 00:37:12,66
在鹅城
in Goose Town,

2277
00:37:13,16 --> 00:37:14,71
你黄四郎是老大！
Master Huang is our real boss!

2278
00:38:36,84 --> 00:38:37,90
明白吗？ 不明白
- Know what I mean? - No

2279
00:38:38,12 --> 00:38:39,75
我是做什么生意的？明白吗？
Know what I do for a living?

2280
00:38:39,92 --> 00:38:40,59
不明白
No.

2281
00:38:40,76 --> 00:38:42,67
小半个民国的烟土
Half the opium smokers in this nation

2282
00:38:42,84 --> 00:38:44,63
都是黄老爷您在贩卖
rely on Master Huang for their supply!

2283
00:38:44,80 --> 00:38:48,75
错！不过是给刘都统当跑腿的
No, I'm only a pawn for General Liu.

2284
00:38:48,92 --> 00:38:51,15
而且只是其中一条腿
I'm just one of his runners!

2285
00:38:51,32 --> 00:38:53,43
那么刘都统到底有几条腿呢？
How many runners does Liu have?

2286
00:38:53,64 --> 00:38:55,11
三条叹
Three.

2287
00:39:50,36 --> 00:39:55,03
明白！事成之后，一百八十万如数奉还
Yes, we'll pay you back $1.8 million,

2288
00:39:55,20 --> 00:39:59,07
咱们分两大家族那点儿钱！
and split the dollars from the others.

2289
00:39:59,84 --> 00:40:01,83
一百八十万不用还！
There's no need to pay him back!

2290
00:40:02,08 --> 00:40:03,79
不就是剿匪么！剿！
We'll hit these bandits hard!

2291
00:40:03,96 --> 00:40:06,19
咱们把张麻子劫走的那点钱
Whatever they seized in the past,

2292
00:40:06,36 --> 00:40:08,55
全拿回来，还给黄老爷！
we will retrieve for the Master.

2293
00:40:09,52 --> 00:40:10,23
到那个时候
Look at the bigger picture,

2294
00:40:10,40 --> 00:40:13,71
这一百八十万就是九牛身上的一根毛
the $1.8 million bounty is but a strand of hair.

2295
00:40:13,88 --> 00:40:14,71
您还在意吗？
Surely you won't mind!

2296
00:40:14,88 --> 00:40:17,91
不就是个小小的张麻子吗？办他！
We'll get rid of Pocky Zhang!

2297
00:40:18,36 --> 00:40:18,83
硬！
Cool!

2298
00:40:19,00 --> 00:40:19,98
硬吗？够硬！
- Cool enough? - Very cool!

2299
00:40:20,16 --> 00:40:21,51
硬不硬以后再说！
We can discuss that later.

2300
00:40:21,68 --> 00:40:23,35
我脑子里想的只有一件事
The only thing I want to do now

2301
00:40:23,56 --> 00:40:26,35
替黄老爷把这条腿接上！
is to fix Master's crippled leg.

2302
00:40:26,76 --> 00:40:29,03
一个张麻子也太嚣张了！
Pocky Zhang's such a nuisance.

2303
00:40:29,24 --> 00:40:31,87
欺负到黄哥头上了，不答应
He shouldn't have messed with Master Huang!

2304
00:40:32,24 --> 00:40:32,75
喝酒
Let's top up.

2305
00:40:34,88 --> 00:40:37,67
我以为，酒一口一口喝
I believe in taking our time,

2306
00:40:37,84 --> 00:40:39,27
路一步一步走
doing things step by step!

2307
00:40:39,44 --> 00:40:41,07
步子迈大了，喀！
I don't want to break my balls

2308
00:40:41,36 --> 00:40:42,27
容易一场空
by over-stretching!

2309
00:40:42,44 --> 00:40:44,51
应该先把钱分清楚
We should agree on the split first,

2310
00:40:44,68 --> 00:40:45,87
再说接腿的事儿
before thinking of how to fix his leg.

2311
00:43:10,76 --> 00:43:14,03
嘘！安静一点
Quiet, quiet...

2312
00:43:14,40 --> 00:43:16,39
那么彼时彼刻
So it was there and then...

2313
00:43:16,60 --> 00:43:21,39
,｝合如此时此刻
A bit like, here and now!

2314
00:43:23,56 --> 00:43:26,67
竟能如此相像
What a coincidence!

2315
00:43:26,84 --> 00:43:29,40
像！很像！
Exactly!

2316
00:43:29,88 --> 00:43:33,19
不过你比他缺了一样东西
But you're missing something.

2317
00:32:03,44 --> 00:32:05,19
大哥不应该听他的
Chief should have ignored Tang.

2318
00:32:05,36 --> 00:32:07,35
姓汤的不是个好玩意
He is a good-for-nothing!

2319
00:32:13,88 --> 00:32:17,63
六爷，黄四郎这招叫杀人不用刀
Huang kills without lifting a finger!

2320
00:32:17,80 --> 00:32:20,71
我给你爹出的招叫杀人诛心
We must retaliate by destroying his soul.

2321
00:32:20,88 --> 00:32:24,35
不能拼命啊！拼命还怎么赚钱！
We can't jeopardise our chance to get rich!

2322
00:32:34,00 --> 00:32:34,98
六子
Six...

2323
00:32:35,76 --> 00:32:37,87
赚钱对我算个事儿吗？
I do not care about being rich.

2324
00:32:38,04 --> 00:32:40,87
我不是要杀人诛心，是没想出好办法
But I must come up with a game plan

2325
00:32:41,28 --> 00:32:43,99
我要把黄四郎连根都拔掉
to rid of Huang once and for all

2326
00:32:44,88 --> 00:32:46,23
给我点时间
Give me time,

2327
00:32:47,24 --> 00:32:50,67
六子，爹发誓一定给你报仇！
Pop will avenge your death.

2328
00:32:55,40 --> 00:32:56,79
把脸收拾收拾
Show your respect!

2329
00:32:58,00 --> 00:33:00,07
六爷，一路走好
Have a safe journey, Six.

2330
00:33:00,80 --> 00:33:03,55
六爷，一路走好！
Safe travel, Six!

2331
00:33:08,56 --> 00:33:09,91
先打哪一张牌？
How should I play my hand?

2332
00:33:11,00 --> 00:33:15,07
请客、斩首、收下当狗！
Banquet, kill him or throw him to the dogs?

2333
00:33:15,24 --> 00:33:15,91
斩！
I'd say kill him!

2334
00:33:16,08 --> 00:33:16,91
错！
No!

2335
00:33:17,08 --> 00:33:18,14
错？
No?

2336
00:33:18,76 --> 00:33:20,11
请客！
Host a banquet!

2337
00:33:20,84 --> 00:33:22,51
鸿门宴！凶多吉少
Dinner invitation! It's a death trap!

2338
00:33:22,68 --> 00:33:24,95
杀人诛心，赫然奏效！
Our ploy is working!

2339
00:33:25,12 --> 00:33:26,39
我再送你一个字
I have another idea: delay tactics.

2340
00:33:26,60 --> 00:33:28,79
拉！拉得越久，赚得越多
The longer we drag this on the better!

2341
00:33:28,96 --> 00:33:31,03
到时候跪在这儿的就是黄四郎本人
Huang will end up kneeling here.

2342
00:33:31,20 --> 00:33:32,55
什么鸿门宴！
What kind of banquet is this?

2343
00:38:26,52 --> 00:38:30,75
这小子到底在哪呢？
Where is he, then?

2344
00:38:30,92 --> 00:38:33,51
听黄爷给咱们聊聊
Let Master Huang enlightens us.

2345
00:38:33,92 --> 00:38:36,67
此人盘踞鹅城周边交通咽喉
He has grabbed Goose Town by its balls!

2346
00:28:49,20 --> 00:28:51,31
你要是肚子里只有一碗粉
If there's only one,

2347
00:28:51,52 --> 00:28:53,23
我死！
I'll die.

2348
00:28:55,56 --> 00:28:58,67
要是有两碗粉，我陪六爷一起死
If he has two bowls in him, I'll die with him!

2349
00:28:59,04 --> 00:29:00,55
凉粉呢？
Where's the jelly?

2350
00:29:01,44 --> 00:29:05,31
太浅了，我看不见
Deeper! I can't see.

2351
00:29:09,12 --> 00:29:10,87
六爷！佩服！
Very gutsy, sir!

2352
00:29:11,04 --> 00:29:14,15
凉粉在肠子里，你得横着拉一下
Try sliding the blade sideway,

2353
00:42:28,24 --> 00:42:30,31
你们可以把我供出来嘛！
Implicate me for all you like.

2354
00:42:30,68 --> 00:42:32,27
不要委屈自己哦！
I couldn't care less!

2355
00:42:32,44 --> 00:42:36,39
马县长，我早看出，你非等闲之辈
Governor. I sense that you're special.

2356
00:42:36,60 --> 00:42:37,15
不敢当
I am flattered.

2357
00:42:37,32 --> 00:42:39,88
不过，有胆子剿匪的人
But those who waged war on the bandits,

2358
00:42:40,04 --> 00:42:41,67
九死一生
none has survived.

2359
00:42:41,84 --> 00:42:44,14
哦，何以见得？
Why not?

2360
00:42:44,32 --> 00:42:46,99
张麻子非同凡人
Pocky Zhang is a tough cookie.

2361
00:42:48,32 --> 00:42:52,15
二十年前，我们有过一面之缘
I met him once 20 years ago.

2362
00:42:53,40 --> 00:42:55,51
竟有如此的缘分
Isn't that fate?

2363
00:42:56,52 --> 00:42:59,35
那么，缘从何起呢？
How did it happen?

2364
00:42:59,60 --> 00:43:02,83
灯火阑珊，他蓦然回首
He stood by a lantern and turned towards me,

2365
00:43:03,00 --> 00:43:06,78
而我，却隐藏在灯影里
and I was standing in the shade.

2366
00:43:07,88 --> 00:43:09,39
一个在明处
He was well lit up,

2367
00:43:09,68 --> 00:43:10,59
一个在暗处
and you're in the dark!

2368
00:35:17,12 --> 00:35:19,27
当我的介错人
to ritualistically cut my head off

2369
00:35:19,64 --> 00:35:23,59
砍下我人头，高挂艳阳楼顶！
and hang it from the restaurant.

2370
00:35:28,20 --> 00:35:29,31
万一不是我
If I'm proven innocent,

2371
00:35:29,52 --> 00:35:32,67
那就是辱我名声
those who slandered me

2372
00:35:33,08 --> 00:35:34,71
欺骗县长
and shamed you in the process...

2373
00:35:36,60 --> 00:35:37,43
你们自裁
will have to kill themselves.

2374
00:35:37,64 --> 00:35:40,99
要么三命抵一命，要么随时告发我
It's me against these three.

2375
00:35:41,16 --> 00:35:42,99
我随时死
I am ready.

2376
00:35:49,16 --> 00:35:52,75
黄老爷，我听说自裁用短刀
You should use this for disembowelment.

2377
00:35:53,00 --> 00:35:54,59
长刀归介错人
The full blade is for your second.

2378
00:35:54,76 --> 00:35:55,79
是吗？
Really?

2379
00:35:58,24 --> 00:36:03,59
果然在行！县长随时可以当我的介错人
It's great to have an expert as my second!

2380
00:36:05,72 --> 00:36:07,51
马县长，请！
This way, please.

2381
00:38:55,60 --> 00:38:57,35
黄老爷还是条大腿
And Master is the most able one!

2382
00:38:57,56 --> 00:38:59,27
对！大腿！
Yes, the strongest one!

2383
00:38:59,44 --> 00:39:00,87
可是我这条腿…
But this runner,

2384
00:39:01,04 --> 00:39:02,15
断了！
is now crippled!

2385
00:39:02,60 --> 00:39:03,11
断了？
Crippled?

2386
00:39:03,28 --> 00:39:03,83
怎么断的？
What happened?

2387
00:39:04,00 --> 00:39:07,23
我的货十回有八回被张麻子劫走了！
Zhang has seized nearly all my goods.

2388
00:39:07,40 --> 00:39:09,83
你想想，他赚了多少钱？
Imagine what he can make from them.

2389
00:39:10,00 --> 00:39:12,07
那这个张麻子很富有啊！
He must be very well off!

2390
00:39:12,24 --> 00:39:13,63
还有这种事儿？
I wonder if this is true.

2391
00:39:14,12 --> 00:39:16,71
如果你们可以去剿匪的话
You can write your own cheque,

2392
00:39:16,88 --> 00:39:19,39
钱要多少有多少
if you can take him out!

2393
00:39:19,60 --> 00:39:21,43
我们没胆子剿匪
We wouldn't dare to!

2394
00:39:21,68 --> 00:39:24,19
但是，借剿匪之名敛财的胆子
But if this can make us rich,

2395
00:39:24,36 --> 00:39:26,43
还是有，而且很大！
I wouldn't mind having a go!

2396
00:39:28,36 --> 00:39:31,79
那就不要怪我！就怪你们没出息
Then blame yourself for your timidity!

2397
00:39:32,08 --> 00:39:34,75
不过，我还可以帮你们一个忙
But I would be happy to assist.

2398
00:39:34,92 --> 00:39:36,99
我出钱，当诱饵
I can put up money as a bait.

2399
00:39:37,16 --> 00:39:40,94
我出多少，两大家族必须出多少！
The families have to match my contribution.

2400
00:39:41,12 --> 00:39:43,68
就等您这句话呢！足够！
We're hoping you'd say that.

2401
00:39:43,84 --> 00:39:45,19
那您出八十万？
How about $800,000?

2402
00:39:45,32 --> 00:39:48,15
不！我出一百八十万
No! I'll put up $1.8 million!

2403
00:39:48,32 --> 00:39:50,19
出得多，赚得多！
The more the merrier!

2404
00:43:33,36 --> 00:43:35,43
不会是脸上的麻子吧
You mean his facial scars?

2405
00:43:35,64 --> 00:43:36,75
当然不是
Of course not.

2406
00:43:37,16 --> 00:43:38,30
那么是什么呢？
Then what is it?

2407
00:40:46,04 --> 00:40:47,99
你还聊钱是吧？不聊接腿？
If you want to settle the split now,

2408
00:40:48,16 --> 00:40:49,38
那你们俩聊吧
then just carry on.

2409
00:40:49,88 --> 00:40:51,43
师爷，你定
Counselor, you decide.

2410
00:40:52,44 --> 00:40:53,66
先聊钱吧
About the dollars,

2411
00:40:53,84 --> 00:40:56,11
钱到手，按照惯例，三七分
Iet's do a customary 30-70 split.

2412
00:40:56,28 --> 00:40:58,71
你也太不仗义了吧！
How can you even say that?

2413
00:40:58,88 --> 00:41:01,44
黄老爷为这事忙前忙后
Master Huang is so instrumental.

2414
00:41:01,64 --> 00:41:04,02
你就分人家三成？
And you give him only 30%?

2415
00:41:04,92 --> 00:41:07,03
怎么也得对半分啊！
Let's go 50-50!

2416
00:41:10,40 --> 00:41:11,87
那我…那我错了
My apologies, Master Huang.

2417
00:41:12,04 --> 00:41:12,99
你太错了
So inconsiderate!

2418
00:41:13,16 --> 00:41:14,19
师爷
Counselor,

2419
00:41:14,36 --> 00:41:17,79
我们还是听县长的，对半分
I'll go along with that: 50-50.

2420
00:41:19,04 --> 00:41:20,95
如果真有胆子剿匪
If you've the guts to take on the bandits,

2421
00:41:21,12 --> 00:41:23,03
两大家族的钱
the dollars from the two families,

2422
00:41:23,96 --> 00:41:25,15
就值一根毛
are but strands of hair!

2423
00:41:25,32 --> 00:41:25,91
一根毛！
Strands of hair!

2424
00:41:26,08 --> 00:41:27,79
哪是一根啊！
May not be even that!

2425
00:41:28,00 --> 00:41:29,91
胆子你是有的
I know you have the courage.

2426
00:41:30,28 --> 00:41:31,26
本事呢？
But ability-wise...?

2427
00:41:31,44 --> 00:41:35,51
我凭什么相信你能剿张麻子？
How do I know if you can overcome Zhang?

2428
00:41:36,44 --> 00:41:39,39
黄老爷，容兄弟问你个问题
May I ask you a question, sir?

2429
00:41:39,60 --> 00:41:40,15
请
Go ahead.

2430
00:41:40,32 --> 00:41:42,88
张麻子能劫你的货
If Zhang can seize your goods,

2431
00:41:43,04 --> 00:41:44,99
为什么不能进你的家呢？
why can't he break in here?

2432
00:41:45,16 --> 00:41:48,70
我这碉楼，固若金汤
My citadel is impregnable.

2433
00:41:48,88 --> 00:41:51,51
易守难攻，他进不来！
There's no way that he can get in.

2434
00:41:51,68 --> 00:41:53,71
那你怎么就真的相信
Are you sure

2435
00:41:53,88 --> 00:41:56,95
只有我跟师爷进了你的碉楼呢？
that we're the only ones here?

2436
00:42:04,32 --> 00:42:05,27
说让咱们撤？
An order to retreat!

2437
00:42:05,44 --> 00:42:06,95
撤？ 那撤么？
- Split? - You sure?

2438
00:42:07,16 --> 00:42:08,14
撤
Let's split.

2439
00:42:10,52 --> 00:42:12,95
“遵命，但我很担心你”
"Chief, watch your back."

2440
00:42:13,12 --> 00:42:14,15
听见了吧？
Did you hear that?

2441
00:42:14,40 --> 00:42:15,11
听见了
Yes.

2442
00:42:15,28 --> 00:42:18,67
张麻子进不来的地方，我能进来
Where Pocky fails to breach, I succeeded!

2443
00:42:18,84 --> 00:42:22,07
张麻子不想死的时候，我能让他死
I can kill him when he is least expecting it.

2444
00:42:27,60 --> 00:42:28,07
又死一个！
Another one bites the dust!

2445
02:06:39,80 --> 02:06:41,23
好，保重大哥
Chief, take care.

2446
02:06:41,44 --> 02:06:41,91
保重
Take care.

2447
02:06:42,00 --> 02:06:42,79
大哥再见
Goodbye, Chief!

2448
02:06:44,68 --> 02:06:45,82
大哥再见
Bye, Chief!

2449
02:06:48,60 --> 02:06:49,74
再见大哥
Bye, Chief!

2450
02:06:54,92 --> 02:06:58,23
张麻子！
"Pocky" Zhang!

2451
02:07:19,16 --> 02:07:23,51
老六，老二，师爷，夫人
Six, Two, Counselor, Madam...

2452
02:07:23,68 --> 02:07:25,11
你们看到了吧
Did you see that?

2453
02:08:13,36 --> 02:08:15,82
老三，去上海还是浦东？
Three, Shanghai or Pudong?

2454
02:08:16,64 --> 02:08:19,10
老三，去浦东还是上海？
Three, Pudong or Shanghai?
